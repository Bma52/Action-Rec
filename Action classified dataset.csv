I am a bit of an ASUS fan, having used their products for many years due to their build quality and reliability, (I owned an ASUS laptop in the Vista era and it was a great machine, I also have a self-built desktop based on an ASUS Maximus VIII Hero motherboard that is still going strong today, almost 5 years later).After much deliberation over getting the $200 cheaper Zephyrus g14 or a MSI GS66, I came across this model. Despite the g14 being a bit faster than this model, I decided on the m15 because it seems to have almost everything that I was looking for in a laptop: Thunderbolt 3 support, an Ethernet jack, RTX graphics, an open secondary M.2 slot, a 1 TB SSD preinstalled, better temps than the g14, a serviceable battery, at least one non-soldered slot for RAM, and a color calibrated 4k display.There is one really useful feature that I was unaware of before I bought the laptop: MyASUS (the built in software) includes a battery health manager to increase the longevity of your battery. If you leave it plugged in all the time in a docking station, it can be set to prevent the battery from charging beyond 60% or 80% of capacity depending on your chosen setting. It only stops the charging while the program is running in the background and can easily be disabled if you plan on taking the laptop on the road and need to charge to full capacity. The display is nice and crisp, Windows 10 v2004 still has some bugs with the default 250% display scaling in some programs. iTunes is barely useable (not surprised, it is Apple""s issue). I also haven""t figured out the best setting for games yet either. Playing games at 4k with the default Windows scaling seems to downscale some games, although I am not entirely sure. (I had to run the nVidia RTX Elevator demo using compatibility mode to disable the scaling to get it to even open.) Jedi Fallen Order runs at ultra settings and 4k resolution fairly well, it dropped a few frames but it was not unplayable. That is to be expected of the RTX 2060. This is not the max-q variant of the 2060. See the attached screenshot of GPU-Z for more info. When the laptop is set to turbo mode, it will increase the GPU""s clock speed up to 2025 Mhz as needed.I don""t notice much if any ghosting on the display, I am not a competitive online gamer so a high refresh rate isn""t as important to me. Watching movies is a fair experience, the display has amazing color and contrast but there is some flashlighting in the corners of the screen on dark scenes that can be an annoyance and some movie playing apps tend to get the fans ramped up as well, which can drown out the mediocre speakers. A good pair of headphones would make it a much better experience.The keyboard is excellent compared to the butterfly keyboard on my mac, the keys are stiff and have a good tactile feel to them. The Aura backlighting is nice to have although it could be just a bit brighter. Keyboard backlight is just right at max brightness in the dark, and unlike the silver keyboard on the g14, the keyboard is easily legible on the m15 in the light with the backlight on or off. I also like the fact that F5 is set to change the boost mode with a tap and F6 is a shortcut to launch the windows snipping tool. I am not aware of there being a Fn lock on this laptop though, so you always have to hold the Fn key first.I hope that ASUS will push out a BIOS update in the future that allows you to disable the power button LED, it is bigger and brighter than all of the other status leds below the screen and it appears to always be red. It is slightly annoying to have it in the corner of your vision constantly.Finally, I wanted a laptop with good linux support. I moved the factory NVME M.2 SSD into slot 2 and installed a 250Gb SATA M.2 drive in slot 1. Only slot 1 supports SATA M.2 drives but both will support NVME drives. I was surprised when installing Fedora 32 that everything was fully supported on the laptop as far as I cold tell. The intel integrated graphics are enabled by default and  drivers for nVidia had to be installed manually which also requires Secure Boot to be disabled in the UEFI to get them to load. It appears to be running very smooth so far. I also tested booting off a USB drive with Linux Mint 19.3 but driver support for that was lacking with no touchpad or wifi support out of the box.All-in-all this is a beautiful laptop with quality hardware and good build quality. I would easily recommend it for the power user or professional that likes to play a AAA title here and there and wants a laptop that can play them in style.",4,positive,The person likes the display screen of this laptop to watch movies on it,"Watching movies is a fair experience, the display has amazing color",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/d6248ab809fefaf361aabb1ddbb18e17,2021-10-24T17:31:02,"Watching movies is a fair experience, the display has amazing color and contrast but there is some flashlighting in the corners of the screen on dark scenes that can be an annoyance and some movie playing apps tend to get the fans ramped up as well, which can drown out the mediocre speakers.",WatchAction,Action Exist

So, lets go over the pros and cons.Pros- very bright, up to 400 nits- 4k res, with 100% adobe RGB color accuracy, this machine is incredible for content creation- good gpu- decent cpu- very nice, tactile keyboard- accurate, glass trackpad- decent ports- lightweight, not super obvious that it was built for gaming- the usb c port has thunderbolt 3, so it can charge your device and you can hook up an e-gpuCons- if you are ONLY looking to game, this isn""t the machine for you, this is because of the 4k screen. AAA games will not run well on this in 4k. The gpu is good, but not that good. When you degrade a game to 1080p on this screen to play more powerful games, it looks more blurry than if it was on a native 1080p screen.- the keyboard is very good, but rgb is one zone if you care about that- fans can be very loud, especially if the game is demanding- the cpu isn""t ryzen. Ryzen cpu""s have beaten intel by miles this year, so its a shame this doesn""t have one- the battery isn""t so good. With the 4k screen and a dedicated gpu, this computer drains battery fast. It only lasted 5 hours doing some web browsing and youtube, even less if you are playing games. Also, no nvidia optimus, so disabling the dedicated gpu isn""t an option to save power. However, while running on battery, armoury crate gives you an option to stop all programs using a gpu, so there is a bright side.-  there is no mini usb ports. There is usb c, but for people with older phones like me, there isn""t an option to plug in to charge my phone or transfer data.- no webcam, i assume this was to minimize bezelsConclusion            Overall, this computer is amazing for content creation, viewing media, or just being amazed by all the colors and extra pixels.

Coming from a 2012 MacBook Pro model this is undoubtedly an upgrade. Apple^s design certainly does not disappoint. I wasn^t sure about the Gold color but ended up loving it. Even though the laptop is made of a full aluminum chassis, it is very light and easy to handle. I do worry a bit about the glass-like Apple logo as it seems that it may scratch easily. The top is rather stiff, and it takes two hands to open, which I find a tiny bit annoying. The keyboard takes half the layout, and the black keys are well spaced. The touchpad is one of the biggest ones out there, which I really appreciate. As always, Apple has the built quality well covered.Unfortunately, the MacBook Air only has 2 USB-C ports. One is used for power and that leaves only one port. This is a bit of an inconvenience as I had to get an IO dongle. There is also a 3.5mm audio jack, which is nice to have, even if I have gone fully wireless. The typing experience is simply amazing. The keys are very responsive and have a nice spring to them. The trackpad is also highly responsive and clicking on it feels great. This is the one thing that truly separates it from the rest, in my opinion.I must say that the camera is rather mediocre, being only 720p. While it works OK for facetime, I can^t do streaming as it is too grainy in dark settings and the angle is narrow. So, now I have an external cam plugged into the dongle, but makes it a bit more cumbersome. As far as performance and specs (i3, 8GB RAM, 256GB), I wouldn^t say they are the best, but good enough for what I need. I do not use a laptop for video/sound editing, coding, or graphics. I do a lot of web-based work, emails, and write a lot. I also watch media content on the couch or in bed, which is how I believe this laptop works best. The screen, which has a resolution of 2560 x 1600 (Retina), is very crisp, vibrant, bright, and quite reflective as well. I like the screen""s 3:2 format because it shows more of webpages than the standard 16:9. The sound coming out of this laptop is still top-notch, loud and clear, with a little bit of bass, which is uncommon for most laptops.In the end, the MacBook Air is not a powerhouse in specs, lacks inputs/outputs, and has a mediocre cam, making it perhaps difficult to recommend to someone who needs a high-end PC^s performance.

1385,1385,1248,"Google - Pixelbook Go 13.3"" Touch-Screen Chromebook - Intel Core m3 - 8GB Memory - 64GB Solid State Drive - Just Black",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/GA00519_US,CarryAction,Person,Travel,Lightweight,"The new Pixelbook Go is Google^s latest series of Chromebooks, and it is absolutely fantastic. Apparently, it is intended to be a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂscaled downÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Pixelbook Chromebook. The Pixelbook Go is available in several configurations including this entry-level model which has an Intel Core m3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of SSD storage. The next level model has an Intel Core i5 CPU with either 8GB or 16GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The top tier has an Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. All 3 CPUs are 8th generation. The first two models have Full HD, 1920x1080, 16x9 Aspect Ratio, 13.3ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Touchscreen Displays, while the top tier model adds a 4k, Ultra HD Display. The Corning Concore glass touchscreen panels are very reflective, which is very typical of touchscreens and which also obviously readily collect fingerprints. The touchscreen is very responsive and pleasant to use. Inasmuch as Google used Corning Concore glass, it is reasonable to surmise that these are ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂOne Glass SolutionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ (OGS) screens, which utilize a sheet of high-strength Concore Glass as the top sheet of the display panel, rather than a second sheet of glass being laminated to the top of the panel. This results in a thinner, lighter and more economical display panel, and undoubtedly contributes to the extremely thin, 0.5ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ thickness profile of the Pixelbook Go. Off-axis angle viewing is very decent, but of course the greater the off-axis angle, the more visibility, contrast and color fidelity deteriorate. Overall, the display genuinely appears to be excellent. It is bright and vivid, with good color rendition and color fidelity, and is very nice to view. Videos and TV streams look great and don^t suffer from buffering or lagging.The clamshell case is very impressive. The painted magnesium alloy case is a very elegant and high-end attribute. It both looks and feels very impressive, and it is reasonable to surmise that it is likely to be very durable. The bottom of the case is scalloped. Perhaps that is for structure, perhaps it is merely aesthetic, but perhaps it might have been designed to serve both as a heat-sink with the additional surface area, as well as providing convection cooling via the scalloped channels. In fact, when the computer is working hard, such as when running multiple video streams, the bottom of the Pixelbook Go, as well as the area above the keyboard get palpably warm. This Pixelbook Go is remarkably lightweight. The specifications claim 2.3lbs (1061g). The size, weight and tough magnesium case really make this easy to move around and easy and convenient to carry and makes it the default travelling device.On initial setup, the Pixelbook Go commenced a lengthy update process which evidently included updating most or all of the apps as well as the device^s firmware (including a notification that the touchpad firmware was being updated). Flashing the firmware is likely what consumed most of the time. As is standard with all Chromebooks, setup is extremely easy, and if you choose to sync devices, all browser shortcuts, passwords, etc. will be automatically imported to this device during the initial setup process.The backlit keyboard has very nice feel and key rebound, and relatively quiet sound. Key travel is short, and the keyboard is compact, necessarily constrained by the dimensions of the case. Typing is very comfortable with this high-quality keyboard, and I find backlighting to be absolutely indispensable, and an absolute necessity. When the Pixelbook Go is sleeping, touching any key or the touchpad awakens the display and backlit keyboard. The touchpad is oversized and responsive, a nice and convenient attribute.Even in this base configuration with the Core m3 CPU and 8GB of RAM, the Pixelbook Go performed very well with many open browser windows and tabs and multiple live-TV streams running simultaneously. I really expected the unit to choke with a far less demanding load on the CPU and video sections. This performance was truly very impressive. This is a very powerful and capable Chromebook. This base, entry-level configuration is not at all inferior or insufficient. In fact, it is genuinely excellent.The battery life on the Pixelbook Go is really great. Google claims up to 12 hours of use, but obviously battery life is extremely dependent on how the computer is being used, and especially how much time the screen is active. I^m finding that all-day use for browsing, email (many), live-streaming news broadcasts, etc. is well within the battery capacity. In fact, during the course of a single day I used the Pixelbook Go extensively, with at least 7 to 10 tabs or browser instances active throughout, the screen/display kept on throughout and including 6.5 hours of live-streaming TV in addition to the foregoing. After 11.5 hours of this very heavy utilization, 11.5 hours of screen on including 6.5 hours of live-streaming broadcast TV, the Pixelbook Go reported 6% remaining battery capacity. If this Pixelbook Go had only typical, intermittent use during the day, and the screen was allowed to turn off and the computer had any time of no activity in which to ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂsleepÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ, I am certain that the run-time would have exceeded the claimed 12 hour capacity. In fact, with this very heavy use example, I^m confident that the battery would have kept the Chromebook alive for another 0.5 hours, easily. Demonstrating fantastic battery performance, coupled with the superior portability of the Pixelbook Go, this is obviously the Chromebook to take along when away from home.The camera works well, but is nothing special. It^s fine for video chats (its intended purpose). The audio is stereo (of course) and sounds excellent. The audio quality, fidelity, volume and projection were all very good, and the stereo separation has a nice spatial quality that makes the Pixelbook Go pleasant to listen to. There is a headphone jack and Bluetooth headphones are of course supported. The Wi-Fi performance is also excellent. The Wi-Fi specs include: 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, 2x2 (MIMO), dual-band (2.4 GHz, 5.0 GHz), and it utilized the full available bandwidth of the Wi-Fi stream, with its 2x2 Mimo.Whereas almost everything about the hardware platform of the Pixelbook Go appears to be first rate, Google clearly economized on the number of ports provided. There are only two USB-C ports (one on each side) and a headphone jack (3.5mm). Additionally, one of those USB-C jacks must be used for battery charging. There is no SD Card slot and no USB-A ports to accept the ubiquitous USB thumb drives that we all use. At the price levels of these computers, there really should be more connectivity options, inclusive of SD Card acceptance.A perplexing matter is that of the pre-established obsolescence schedule for all Chromebooks and Google Pixel phones. Chromebooks, irrespective of manufacturer, are currently only supported for 6.5 years (thankfully increased from 5 years in 2017) with OS and Security updates (termed the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂAuto Update Expiration (AUE) dateÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ by Google). The 6.5 years begins when the particular hardware platform is initially released into the retail channel (not from when the particular model enters the marketplace, nor when the computer is purchased). Pixel phones receive only three years of support. This Pixelbook Go is replacing a less than five year old Acer Chromebook that has already received its ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfinal update notificationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ from Google. It still operates perfectly well, but without Security updates it is destined for consignment to oblivion. These support policies do not appear to be in the best interests of consumers. Additionally, since most electronics in the US are not recycled (and many components are not recyclable at all), these end of life policies increase the amount of landfill waste and environmental pollution.Overall, the Pixelbook Go is absolutely a first rate, top-of-the-line Chromebook. It is quite powerful and fast. It is compact and light-weight, and epitomizes portability and convenience. The case is elegant and a good measure above typical computers, with its thin profile and sleek magnesium shell. The display is also outstanding, and in addition to being full HD, it is a touch-screen. The battery performance is truly excellent, exceeding expectations. The keyboard sounds and feels great, and is backlit.

Apparently, it is intended to be a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂscaled downÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Pixelbook Chromebook. The Pixelbook Go is available in several configurations including this entry-level model which has an Intel Core m3 CPU, 8GB of RAM and 64GB of SSD storage. The next level model has an Intel Core i5 CPU with either 8GB or 16GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The top tier has an Intel Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. All 3 CPUs are 8th generation. The first two models have Full HD, 1920x1080, 16x9 Aspect Ratio, 13.3ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Touchscreen Displays, while the top tier model adds a 4k, Ultra HD Display. The Corning Concore glass touchscreen panels are very reflective, which is very typical of touchscreens and which also obviously readily collect fingerprints. The touchscreen is very responsive and pleasant to use. Inasmuch as Google used Corning Concore glass, it is reasonable to surmise that these are ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂOne Glass SolutionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ (OGS) screens, which utilize a sheet of high-strength Concore Glass as the top sheet of the display panel, rather than a second sheet of glass being laminated to the top of the panel. This results in a thinner, lighter and more economical display panel, and undoubtedly contributes to the extremely thin, 0.5ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ thickness profile of the Pixelbook Go. Off-axis angle viewing is very decent, but of course the greater the off-axis angle, the more visibility, contrast and color fidelity deteriorate. Overall, the display genuinely appears to be excellent. It is bright and vivid, with good color rendition and color fidelity, and is very nice to view. Videos and TV streams look great and don^t suffer from buffering or lagging.The clamshell case is very impressive. The painted magnesium alloy case is a very elegant and high-end attribute. It both looks and feels very impressive, and it is reasonable to surmise that it is likely to be very durable. The bottom of the case is scalloped. Perhaps that is for structure, perhaps it is merely aesthetic, but perhaps it might have been designed to serve both as a heat-sink with the additional surface area, as well as providing convection cooling via the scalloped channels. In fact, when the computer is working hard, such as when running multiple video streams, the bottom of the Pixelbook Go, as well as the area above the keyboard get palpably warm. This Pixelbook Go is remarkably lightweight. The specifications claim 2.3lbs (1061g). The size, weight and tough magnesium case really make this easy to move around and easy and convenient to carry and makes it the default travelling device.On initial setup, the Pixelbook Go commenced a lengthy update process which evidently included updating most or all of the apps as well as the device^s firmware (including a notification that the touchpad firmware was being updated). Flashing the firmware is likely what consumed most of the time. As is standard with all Chromebooks, setup is extremely easy, and if you choose to sync devices, all browser shortcuts, passwords, etc. will be automatically imported to this device during the initial setup process.The backlit keyboard has very nice feel and key rebound, and relatively quiet sound. Key travel is short, and the keyboard is compact, necessarily constrained by the dimensions of the case. Typing is very comfortable with this high-quality keyboard, and I find backlighting to be absolutely indispensable, and an absolute necessity. When the Pixelbook Go is sleeping, touching any key or the touchpad awakens the display and backlit keyboard. The touchpad is oversized and responsive, a nice and convenient attribute.Even in this base configuration with the Core m3 CPU and 8GB of RAM, the Pixelbook Go performed very well with many open browser windows and tabs and multiple live-TV streams running simultaneously. I really expected the unit to choke with a far less demanding load on the CPU and video sections. This performance was truly very impressive. This is a very powerful and capable Chromebook. This base, entry-level configuration is not at all inferior or insufficient. In fact, it is genuinely excellent.The battery life on the Pixelbook Go is really great.

1577,1577,1251,"Google - Pixelbook Go 13.3"" Touch-Screen Chromebook - Intel Core m3 - 8GB Memory - 64GB Solid State Drive - Just Black",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/GA00519_US,CarryAction,Person,Universal,Lightweight,"Google Pixelbook Go 13.3"" Touch-Screen Chromebook (Intel Core m3; 8GB Memory; 64GB Solid State Drive): My first introduction to Chromebooks a few years ago took me by surprise. They were more competent and compatible than I expected. But, those Chromebook versions were not as lightweight and convenient as I was led to believe. I think Google has made a course correction in this version of the Google Pixelbook Go. While remaining competent and very compatible, it also is more convenient and comfortable enough to take everywhere. This particular model Pixelbook Go has a simple, exceptionally sleek look with a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂgroovyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ bottom surface that adds some uniqueness and ease-of-handling. SETUP: I use a stopwatch these days to test setup and App installation. This Google Pixelbook was ready to use in under 5 minutes. I was online, receiving email, selecting a few more Apps to download and seeing if my photos and movies were ready to review. Yes. I was really ready to work. This notebook required an update, but that didn^t take more than a few more minutes with my fast internet connection. The selection of Apps is incredibly large, with so many useful and free. There are two USB-CÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂµ charging and display outputs (2). I had a fairly generic, multi-port dock available which allowed me to use an ethernet connection, and add USB devices or an external monitor or similar peripherals. I don^t concern myself with ports because I^m willing to trade off to get more portability. PERFORMANCE: While I understand that this is the slower of the available Google Pixelbook Go processors, the included 8GB RAM, the 64GB SSD, as well as the remarkably easy and useful free access (15GB) to Google Drive conceals any limitations. Google Apps are often efficient and mostly compatible. The result is a computer that always feels fast and responsive to anything I wanted to do. The screen is bright, with appropriate contrast, and very colorful. The keyboard has a soft feel, but the keys and trackpad are sensitive and responsive. The speakers are face up, alongside of the keyboard, and can get loud for personal listening. That headphone port makes it easy to connect to an external (not included) system, which you^ll want to add for some better bass. I streamed several movies from my GooglePlay Movie ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlockerÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ, (Finding Nemo and Jersey Boys) to test black levels, skin tones, and color. This is a very high quality screen with a wide and useful field of view. I don^t just work on the road; I love my movies-on-the-go. At just over 2lbs., the Pixelbook Go is very very easy to manage. It^s also great for working wherever you take it. Students will love it. INTEROPERABILITY: The major rationale for a Chromebook for me is lightweight usefulness. Translation? I absolutely need to exchange data, pictures, and videos with my other devices but I hate traveling with unnecessary weight. I took the easy way out for this first test and sent my new Google Pixelbook a series of attachments: TEXT (RTF), WORD, EXCEL, PDF, and JPG. EVERY other file type was handled easily, with the Chromebook offering at least one App to manage or edit my transferred files. Videos of my grandson, created on a MacBook now played on my Pixelbook. My Word document was opened without hiccup by a Google Doc, and my simple EXCEL file was opened by Google Sheet. Both were ready to edit.. . . on this Chromebook. SUMMARY: The Google Pixelbook Go approach, with portability, comfort, ease of use, simpler programs and dependence on online storage challenges notions that you need to lug a powerful, near-desktop to get work done on the road. Transitioning between my newest MacBook pro with i7 and this Google Pixelbook was problem-free. Speed is NOT an issue. In fact, those instances where I^m sitting and waiting often favored the Pixelbook^s simpler demands. Carrying around the Pixelbook just seemed smart, and looked professional. I can easily recommend this Pixelbook Go.",5,positive,The person likes to carry this laptop everywhere ,"While remaining competent and very compatible, it also is more convenient and comfortable enough to take everywhere.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/013a5b45fe222e76e530b0e0fbe9010d,2021-03-21T09:46:01,"While remaining competent and very compatible, it also is more convenient and comfortable enough to take everywhere.",CarryAction,Action Exist

Very lightweight and compact - I can see myself taking this everywhere with me. Also, battery is not quite as advertised but this is typical of all the major brands. HOWEVER.... the one issue that no one seems to be talking about is the lack of repair programs once the warranty expires. With a device this portable, accidents WILL happen and unless you cash in on an extended warranty, this might become a paperweight like the original Pixelbook 2-in-1. (Seriously, google the problems with those devices after 1 year and you""ll see it""s a nightmare getting anyone to touch it)The issue with made by google hardware is that Google doesn""t have the means to repair its own devices for whatever reason and relies on Ubreakitifixit instead. This seems like a good idea, however, a quick search on the Ubreakit site shows almost NO information for the pricing of repairs for Pixelbook Go specifically. If you refer to my included image, a screen repair on the original Pixelbook is $449.99 in the state of Colorado. That is ludicrous and I can""t imagine the Pixelbook Go being any better. After chatting with a Google support agent, they could not offer concise information on this and I""ve yet to hear back from Ubreakit. Big surprise. Long story short - a beautiful device is nothing without a robust company supporting the software AND hardware post-purchase. It is up to the consumer to voice their opinions to the companies that make such decisions. We need to end this disposable technology era considering the valuable materials that go into the processing of each item and the quantity at which we consume. I do hope that more people consider the longevity of their device instead of only the initial quality when evaluating this and other purchases.

HOWEVER.... the one issue that no one seems to be talking about is the lack of repair programs once the warranty expires. With a device this portable, accidents WILL happen and unless you cash in on an extended warranty, this might become a paperweight like the original Pixelbook 2-in-1. (Seriously, google the problems with those devices after 1 year and you""ll see it""s a nightmare getting anyone to touch it)The issue with made by google hardware is that Google doesn""t have the means to repair its own devices for whatever reason and relies on Ubreakitifixit instead. This seems like a good idea, however, a quick search on the Ubreakit site shows almost NO information for the pricing of repairs for Pixelbook Go specifically. If you refer to my included image, a screen repair on the original Pixelbook is $449.99 in the state of Colorado. That is ludicrous and I can""t imagine the Pixelbook Go being any better. After chatting with a Google support agent, they could not offer concise information on this and I""ve yet to hear back from Ubreakit. Big surprise. Long story short - a beautiful device is nothing without a robust company supporting the software AND hardware post-purchase. It is up to the consumer to voice their opinions to the companies that make such decisions. We need to end this disposable technology era considering the valuable materials that go into the processing of each item and the quantity at which we consume. I do hope that more people consider the longevity of their device instead of only the initial quality when evaluating this and other purchases. Google, you can do better and as consumers paying a premium we should expect better.",2,positive,The person likes to carry this laptop everywhere due to its lightweight,Very lightweight and compact - I can see myself taking this everywhere with me.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/d2d266c6da06ffad2f318d38342f04c8,2021-03-28T17:12:04,Very lightweight and compact - I can see myself taking this everywhere with me.,CarryAction,Action Exist

You also get a nice screen that is also a touch screen. And the battery life is amazing as well, even when using the laptop to watch videos. The setup is easy too, but when you start using ChromeOS that""s where the Pixelbook starts to feel limited. It""s pretty much like running Chrome on a Windows PC, but you can only browse the web. You have the ability to run Android apps, but most that I tried just don""t look good as Andriod for tablet never took off and many don""t work. If you""re an advanced user you can install Linux apps which makes the laptop more useful, but most people won""t do this. If you are heavily a google user and don""t need to do more then use a web browser, this may be for you. For most people though I would recommend either going with an iPad or a Windows PC that generally will give you more than the Pixlebook Go due to the limits of the OS currently.

It^s been a minute since I^ve used a Chromebook, a few years back I purchased one for some graduate classes I was taking. This Chromebook feels amazing. Super light, and thin. I^ve been using it for a few days, and I am still pleasantly surprised when I pick it up. The entire frame of the laptops is constructed from magnesium, which is great when you first pickup because it^s nice and cool to the touch. It is easy to open up with one hand, which is a nice bonus. The ridges on the bottom are great as a grip to hold on to, and I think also make it a little easier to keep clean. Seriously, this is super portable; I kept asking my family to pick it up to feel how light it is.The Screen and Sound- Spotify, Youtube, Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Apple TV+; these are all the services I have been using since the day I received it. The screen is great, videos look crispy, and the speakers are amazing. Easy to see in well lit areas, and I normally keep the brightness between 50-75%. Speakers are great for streaming music or watching movies/shows. This thing gets very loud, about 50% is way more than enough for me. Music and videos are clear. There^s good separation in highs, mids, and lows. Lows are definitely a little on the weak side, but I think that^s just a sacrifice of the size and weight of the chromebook.Battery- I^m an educator, and I decided to take this with me for a few days instead of my usual device. Used it most of the day, between lessons, and again when I got home for some entertainment and news. Finished the day with just slightly under 40% battery left. I am absolutely comfortable leaving the charger at home for a day of work.Productivity- I was a little worried in transitioning my workflow to ChromeOS. I primarily use Windows 10 or iPadOS for most of my work. I did have a slight adjustment period, but then I realized that most of the work that I do is already being done in a Chrome browser on those other 2 platforms so the transition was minimal. Also, as a huge bonus, all the work that I get done on this in Google Docs, Slides, etc is saved to the Google Drive automatically, and I can retrieve it from pretty much any device (phones, tablets, computers) that are online.

When she""s not using it, I use it for web browsing, emails, Netflix and have even created a few spreadsheets. Was surprised how amazing the sound was that comes from two speakers on each side of the keyboard. The images on the screen are great too, my MacBook Air looks better of course but for just over $600 it""s perfect. The keyboard is super responsive and comfortable to type.  Love the light weight also as I hold it on my lap when not at my desk. Battery life lasts me all day, have never had an issue running out of juice. Looking for a printer that""s compatible right now, my Brother Laser did not work with it and I bought an Anker adapter for the USB to C connection for some devices. Love it overall and would buy again for sure. :)",5,positive,The person likes to hold this laptop on his/her lap.,Love the light weight also as I hold it on my lap when not at my desk.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/c68addbda25ba05d6b0d8b3f88ee6de9,2021-04-01T10:06:29,Love the light weight also as I hold it on my lap when not at my desk.,HoldAction,Action Exist

Admittedly, the design is perfect for me. It is simple, clean, sleek and matte black everywhere. It is made of magnesium but is coated in some type of material that gives it both a nice feel as well as look. It has a very solid feel in the hand, yet, it is also very light. In addition, the bottom has a ribbed design that I have never seen on laptop before. It is very practical and also gives you confidence when you have it in your hand and are on the go. I have been taking this everywhere and I barely notice the weight and am impressed with how it is holding up.Boot times are near instant and initial set-up is extremely easy (with your Google account), although you can dig deeper on some settings if you like. Even though I had some minor concerns regarding the Intel Core M3 chip going in, performance has been great. That is the beauty of Chrome OS. It does not need much to excel and I could not be happier. Chrome with a slew of tabs is no issue, and I have been able to nail down all of my work with ease using Google^s Suite of services as well as some Microsoft Office Apps when required. Having access to Play Store Apps on the Chromebook is a fantastic change. While not all apps will work, I love seeing continued improvements to the platform. That said, life is not all Gmail and work. The touchscreen is Full HD 1080p, with great brightness levels, nice details and full, rich and vivid color. The speakers, located on both sides of the keyboard, sound unexpectedly, well, awesome. There is lots of volume, some bass (yes, a little bass), and little to no distortion at high volume. I consume a TON of media, both at home as well as when I am out, and this thing is fantastic. I have regularly been streaming YouTube TV, Netflix and more recently Disney+ and have liked what I have been seeing (and hearing). It is a good media experience. Having a touchscreen is great, but ultimately, you need a keyboard. An OK one will beÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦just OK. A bad one? It can ruin an entire computer. A good one? It can be a pleasure to use. That is the case here. It is tough to say, but this may be the best keyboard I have ever used. The layout, spacing and travel are all great. It is extremely quiet and the keys just ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfeel nice.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ It is also backlit with minimal to no bleed through. Google nailed it. If you are a writer or do a lot of typing, try to find one and give it a try. The trackpad is much of the same. Nice size, responsive and a good feel, BUT, whoa, the click is loud. Noticeably loud. By no means a deal-breaker but keep it in mind.Lastly, it is a Chromebook. You will be taking it with you. Everywhere. It doesn^t work without power. Google rates the battery for 12 hours of use and while how long your battery lasts depends on so many factors, I can only say battery life has been great. I have been using my machine pretty hard and generally am doing everything I need and want to throughout the day with battery to spare. Again, your use case is probably different than mine, but I feel confident it won^t be an issue for you. In addition, it comes with a 45W USB-C charger that supports Quick Charge. You should get 2 hours of use from a 20-minute charge. In conclusion, I think this is a fantastic machine. It is well-built, lightweight, portable, and performs well. The display and speakers are great for media, battery life is very strong, and the keyboard is among the best I have used. Chrome OS has evolved a lot over the years and continues to do so.

In the past Chrome OS has not been stellar, but now it turns out to be a great alternative to both Windows and Apple OS. So, after three weeks of constant use It appears to me that the Google Chrome Platform doesn""t need the latest, greatest, most powerful Intel Chip, immense memory, or a huge hard drive to operate fast. It does quite well with the 8th Gen IntelÃÂÃÂ® CoreÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ i5 processor coupled with 8 GB Ram of memory and 128GB SSD. Amazing speed! What also makes this Pixelbook Go so versatile is that I can download numerous Android Apps and software from the Google Play Store like MS Word and Excel. WooHoo! In addition to Google Docs and Presentations this makes this laptop ideal for any kind of productivity for a home office, student, or any professional ""on-the-go"". Here is what I love about this Pixelbook Go:*** DESIGN & BUILD ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ The lightweight magnesium shell is cleverly designed with a matte black finish, ribbed bottom with two rubberized strips to keep this attractive unit from slipping on any hard surfaces. * I love that it is pretty much fingerprint resistant and classy looking too. This sleek unit weighs approximately 2.3 pounds.* It is designed to be super-portable, and as a laptop only. The ribbed bottom makes it easy to grip and carry anywhere. * At only a half inch thick, it is thin enough to slide in my backpack. It can also fit into a medium sized handbag, or carrier. * Love the rounded edges, which make this unit so easy to handle and comfortable in my lap. * What I like about using this unit in my lap is that it does not heat up like my larger Windows unit does.** HARDWARE FEATURES ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ First, the keyboard is backlit, and is adjustable for brightness. The keys are illuminated, individually, without light escaping around the keys perimeter. The Hush Keys are silent and responsive to my touch. * A trackpad is conveniently placed in the very center of the unit. It is sensitive and can be adjusted to accommodate anyone""s personal preferences.* The LCD, Touch Screen display is 13.3 inches with full HD, 1920x1080 pixels. I was impressed with the brilliance and quality while streaming Netflix Christmas movies with my Grand Kids. * The dual stereo speakers deliver unbelievable sound quality for a medium-sized unit, and can be enhanced by an EQ App downloaded from the Play Store for even richer performance. * The 2MP, 1080p front duo cams allow for dynamic videoconferencing in Google Hangouts. Impressive! * There are two USB-C ports and one 3.5mm headphone jack or auxiliary audio output. Either USB-C port can charge this unit using the included 6.5 foot charging cable with the 45W USB-C wall power adapter featuring fold in/out prongs. I discovered that there is a USB-C to SD card adapter, which allows me to use a 128GB SD card as additional storage. I can also use the second USB-C port to connect an additional screen display. * The WI-Fi connection is 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, which allows me to take advantage of my routers ability to MU-MIMO. It features a 2x2 MIMO dual-band Wi-Fi for even faster uninterrupted download speeds for video streaming.* For data storage the Pixelbook incorporates a 128 GB, flash, SSD drive, with low power draw on the battery and decreased heat production.* The Intel i5-8200Y processor is eighth generation, and uses very little power. It is a dual core processor featuring Intel""s Turbo Boost technology. * This Pixelbook Go is also Bluetooth 4.2, which allows me to connect my BT mouse for more efficient scrolling and word processing functions, or, any other BT device like auxiliary speakers or even a printer.*** CHROME OS ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Chrome features thousands of Android apps for productivity and entertainment. I downloaded MS Word and Excel from the Play Store so that I could use this laptop on the road for my part-time, consulting job. I am also impressed with Google Docs and Presentations. * Set-Up was very simple. All I needed was my Wi-Fi connection to my home router and my Google account as outlined in the included Quick Start Guide. The Pixelbook turns ON as I opened the unit. The on-screen instructions guided me through the whole set-up. It took approximately five minutes and I was ready to GO.* What I really appreciate is that Chrome features its own virus protection with automatic updates to includes updating the Chrome OS too. These updates operate in the background and do not require any user interface. This saves me money from buying additional third-party virus protection. Great!* The Chrome OS also provides cloud backups. I found that the more I use this OS the more I wonder if I ever really needed Windows. Chrome is a simple OS to learn, and very User-Friendly. Chrome OS is not bloated with unneeded add-ons and features like Windows, which require higher processing speeds, gobs of RAM memory, and a huge hard drive. * I am amazed at how fast this Pixelbook Go actually is. It automatically turns ON when I open it and goes directly to my designated Home Page in just a few seconds. I primarily use this Pixelbook Go for creating construction-related documents, e-mail, and streaming Netflix movies for entertainment. It performs all my activities with quick speed, which was an unexpected surprise and plus. YaHoo!* I can also connect my Android phone to my Pixelbook for ""Smart Lock"" and message notifications. My Android phone can lock and unlock my Pixelbook if I so choose and allow me to both send and receive messages on my Pixelbook.* I can also sync with my Android phone to connect my Pixelbook to the Internet using my phone""s mobile data (tethering). This comes in handy when there is no WI-FI connection and I need to have an Internet connection to my Pixelbook.* Be aware that the Pixelbook Go can only be BT connected to an Android phone for now. An IOS phone is not compatible at this time.*** BATTERY LIFE ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ For what activities I do and my settings of the backlit key brightness, and screen display levels allow me approximately 10 hours of battery use. YooHoo! About an hour less if I stream a movie. That is more then enough to last me one day of full use. *** SUMMARY ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ After three weeks of everyday use I am totally impressed with this Pixelbook Go. I highly recommend this Pixelbook Go as an efficient alternative to Windows and Mac. It allows me to be productive in creating both Word and Google Documents, and, is fantastic for streaming movies. Just the right size for people on-the-go. For its size processor it is one speedy machine with a simple Chrome OS for everyday computer activities. If you are considering serious gaming, photo, and, or, graphics editing, this machine may not fit your needs. However, I think it is an excellent choice for a student, and, plan on buying one for my Grandson, who is going to be in his first year of college this Spring.

Here is what I love about this Pixelbook Go:*** DESIGN & BUILD ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ The lightweight magnesium shell is cleverly designed with a matte black finish, ribbed bottom with two rubberized strips to keep this attractive unit from slipping on any hard surfaces. * I love that it is pretty much fingerprint resistant and classy looking too. This sleek unit weighs approximately 2.3 pounds.* It is designed to be super-portable, and as a laptop only. The ribbed bottom makes it easy to grip and carry anywhere. * At only a half inch thick, it is thin enough to slide in my backpack. It can also fit into a medium sized handbag, or carrier. * Love the rounded edges, which make this unit so easy to handle and comfortable in my lap. * What I like about using this unit in my lap is that it does not heat up like my larger Windows unit does.** HARDWARE FEATURES ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ First, the keyboard is backlit, and is adjustable for brightness. The keys are illuminated, individually, without light escaping around the keys perimeter. The Hush Keys are silent and responsive to my touch. * A trackpad is conveniently placed in the very center of the unit. It is sensitive and can be adjusted to accommodate anyone""s personal preferences.* The LCD, Touch Screen display is 13.3 inches with full HD, 1920x1080 pixels. I was impressed with the brilliance and quality while streaming Netflix Christmas movies with my Grand Kids. * The dual stereo speakers deliver unbelievable sound quality for a medium-sized unit, and can be enhanced by an EQ App downloaded from the Play Store for even richer performance. * The 2MP, 1080p front duo cams allow for dynamic videoconferencing in Google Hangouts. Impressive! * There are two USB-C ports and one 3.5mm headphone jack or auxiliary audio output. Either USB-C port can charge this unit using the included 6.5 foot charging cable with the 45W USB-C wall power adapter featuring fold in/out prongs. I discovered that there is a USB-C to SD card adapter, which allows me to use a 128GB SD card as additional storage. I can also use the second USB-C port to connect an additional screen display. * The WI-Fi connection is 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, which allows me to take advantage of my routers ability to MU-MIMO. It features a 2x2 MIMO dual-band Wi-Fi for even faster uninterrupted download speeds for video streaming.* For data storage the Pixelbook incorporates a 128 GB, flash, SSD drive, with low power draw on the battery and decreased heat production.* The Intel i5-8200Y processor is eighth generation, and uses very little power. It is a dual core processor featuring Intel""s Turbo Boost technology. * This Pixelbook Go is also Bluetooth 4.2, which allows me to connect my BT mouse for more efficient scrolling and word processing functions, or, any other BT device like auxiliary speakers or even a printer.*** CHROME OS ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Chrome features thousands of Android apps for productivity and entertainment. I downloaded MS Word and Excel from the Play Store so that I could use this laptop on the road for my part-time, consulting job. I am also impressed with Google Docs and Presentations. * Set-Up was very simple. All I needed was my Wi-Fi connection to my home router and my Google account as outlined in the included Quick Start Guide. The Pixelbook turns ON as I opened the unit. The on-screen instructions guided me through the whole set-up. It took approximately five minutes and I was ready to GO.* What I really appreciate is that Chrome features its own virus protection with automatic updates to includes updating the Chrome OS too. These updates operate in the background and do not require any user interface. This saves me money from buying additional third-party virus protection. Great!* The Chrome OS also provides cloud backups. I found that the more I use this OS the more I wonder if I ever really needed Windows. Chrome is a simple OS to learn, and very User-Friendly. Chrome OS is not bloated with unneeded add-ons and features like Windows, which require higher processing speeds, gobs of RAM memory, and a huge hard drive. * I am amazed at how fast this Pixelbook Go actually is. It automatically turns ON when I open it and goes directly to my designated Home Page in just a few seconds. I primarily use this Pixelbook Go for creating construction-related documents, e-mail, and streaming Netflix movies for entertainment. It performs all my activities with quick speed, which was an unexpected surprise and plus. YaHoo!* I can also connect my Android phone to my Pixelbook for ""Smart Lock"" and message notifications. My Android phone can lock and unlock my Pixelbook if I so choose and allow me to both send and receive messages on my Pixelbook.* I can also sync with my Android phone to connect my Pixelbook to the Internet using my phone""s mobile data (tethering). This comes in handy when there is no WI-FI connection and I need to have an Internet connection to my Pixelbook.* Be aware that the Pixelbook Go can only be BT connected to an Android phone for now. An IOS phone is not compatible at this time.*** BATTERY LIFE ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ For what activities I do and my settings of the backlit key brightness, and screen display levels allow me approximately 10 hours of battery use. YooHoo! About an hour less if I stream a movie. That is more then enough to last me one day of full use. *** SUMMARY ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ After three weeks of everyday use I am totally impressed with this Pixelbook Go. I highly recommend this Pixelbook Go as an efficient alternative to Windows and Mac. It allows me to be productive in creating both Word and Google Documents, and, is fantastic for streaming movies. Just the right size for people on-the-go. For its size processor it is one speedy machine with a simple Chrome OS for everyday computer activities. If you are considering serious gaming, photo, and, or, graphics editing, this machine may not fit your needs. However, I think it is an excellent choice for a student, and, plan on buying one for my Grandson, who is going to be in his first year of college this Spring. It""s productivity Apps and Portability make this a great choice for him. If you buy one you won""t be disappointed.",5,positive,"The person likes this laptop""s screen resolution while streaming Netflix movies",I was impressed with the brilliance and quality while streaming Netflix Christmas movies with my Grand Kids.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/6dc4748d1074cb0234f702e9d34519cb,2021-04-01T10:51:35,I was impressed with the brilliance and quality while streaming Netflix Christmas movies with my Grand Kids.,StreamAction,Action Exist

3016,3016,1294,"Google - Pixelbook Go 13.3"" Touch-Screen Chromebook - Intel Core m3 - 8GB Memory - 64GB Solid State Drive - Just Black",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/GA00519_US,ListenAction,Wife,Universal,Programs,"How do I go about telling you how good this device isÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ First thing my use case may be different than yours and so it can be perfect for you while not being the perfect device for meÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ case in pointÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ from getting this I made a realization that this is the absolute perfect device for my wife. She uses the Chrome and Spotify on her computer. This device is absolutely perfect for her. Cruising the internet, editing her blog website, and running her MLM side business are all done on Chrome. Chrome is the full-blown experience and it is by far one of the lightest and nicest looking devices out there. She saw mine and asked why she didn^t have one and said it was perfect for herÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦. So, she will be getting one of these devices for Christmas. Pros:- Keyboard- Instant on- Bright screen- Extremely responsive- Excellent Wi-Fi reception that takes full advantage of the internet connection- Extremely light but still feels solid. - Nice screen (I don^t need 4k on this size of device)- Full Chrome Browser plus access to quite a bit of the play store- Amazing battery life- I have android so my messages sync with the android messages app- Office 365 works nicely - Streaming is awesome (I have an AndroidTV so casting from the this is awesome)Cons:- Not all apps work perfectly and some don^t work at all- Chrome is the only usable browser (can run into compatibility issues on older sites)- Limited OS- No right click on track padYes, I would recommend this deviceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ Now the rest of this is how I use this device which may or may not be useful to you. My challenge was to use this as my only device for a week at work and home. Overall it fell a little short at work but at home it is more than I need and easily turned into my go to device.So first why it is in the end not the perfect device for me, since this won^t apply to 90% of people but if it does then you probably aren^t even looking at this device. I need a program like DrawboardPDF or Bluebeam, a pen input, and a flat writing experience ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ until android or ChromeOS has an app like those I can only complete about 90% of my work on this platform, then the pixel book or slate would be the only physical device I would need at work and home.But now to the first 90% of my work and how I have used this deviceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ And why I love it so muchÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ Build Quality: Just wowÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ I love how light but solid this is, The keyboard is really nice to type on, the mouse pad is accurate (a little hard to get used to no right click but a click and hold instead but that is just adapting to a new OS) , and I actually really like the ridged bottom. I had to google a few shortcuts like screen snip, CAPS Lock, and such but after a day of using this thing pretty constantly for meetings I completely adapted. Another great feature are the speakers, they get loud, like quite loudÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ Like I actually use them and don^t have to go get headphone to hear while I^m watching something while cooking. Lastly, the internal microphone worked quite nicely and people had zero trouble hearing me during meetings. One Issue I ran into was that the track pad didn^t have a right clickÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ I have a mouse that I use with it quite a bit but when I didn^t want to pull out the mouse that could be an issue. Performance: I have the m3 with 8GB of ram, 64GB of storageÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦. The 64GB seemed low however as an almost purely connected device I am nowhere close to filling up the storage. As for how it ranÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ Let me try to describe what I had goingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ I had it docked to dual 27ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ almost 2k monitors, I was using Google Meet for a meeting on one screen with a window of chrome open as well, on another I was running VMware Horizon to log into my virtual desktop for work, and on the third screen I had a combination of outlook, boxer, another instance of chrome, word, cisco teams, and one note that I was jumping betweenÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ and this thing didn^t hiccup onceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ Seriously impressive and I think really shows the idea of this device.Streaming: I have a subscription to Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Disney+, ESPN+, Google Play Music, Spotify, and YouTube Red. I got all of the apps I could since streaming works great in Chrome but sometimes I^m out of Wi-Fi coverage and cell coverage. The only app that isn^t compatible is Disney+. The rest worked awesomely. I also have an AndroidTV so I could cruise Scuba diving locations for my trip that^s coming up on chrome, switch between videos onto the TV, and respond to texts all from my laptop. Instead of needing three devices I got down to just two, the TV and thisÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ Super nice. Productivity: This is where it depends on how you are going to use itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ there is no way that I can use ChromeOS to get my work done, I need to draft and use programs like MathcadÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ But what it does really well is connect into my VM at work using VMWare Horizon. And there is no lagÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ So I am always able to get to my work almost instantly. It is the perfect gateway with booting up instantly and getting rid of any lag which I had thought lag was normal for a VM until I used this. Also, worth noting that this device plugged right into my docking station and without installing anything brought up both monitors and I had three screens to work worth. Granted an instance of VMWare couldn^t use all three but I was able to pull up two different VM instances on different screens with no issues. Google productivity suite works great (I use it to interact with a non-profit I am involved with) But for home and work I mostly use Office 365. The apps are almost full versions and work for simple documents. One other thing to note is the fact that they depend on touchÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ using the mouse works for quite a bit but somethings like spell checking one word you need to touch itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ And this device has a touch screen so this works out pretty nicely. Cisco WebEx didn^t work when plugged into a docking station but works great otherwise, same with Cisco Jabber. WebEx Teams worked great all the way through. VMWare Boxer and outlook apps both have a decent desktop interface. The Files app actually allows you to map share drives which is awesome! Printing worked perfectly; I did have to add my printer via the IP address instead of just clicking on it but that was still super simple. Of course, the Google suite of productivity worked good, though I downloaded the apps, I don^t prefer working in Chrome myself like the pre installed docs app sent you.Overall: Overall, I have realized that this is pretty much the perfect device for 90% of my workÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ In fact, I^ll be using it for just that. And it works for 100% of what I do at home, it is so nice to have the quick response, zero lag, and access to android apps all from a laptop type experience. If any of the situations above fit your use case I would recommend this all dayÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ If you^re a student that wants something nice and affordable and don^t have specific software requirements (this isn^t an engineering students device unless the college has virtualized applications) or if you just want a nice device to use at home and on the Go it would be hard to beat this device for how nice it isÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ I actually can easily fit this into my small backpack with my 45W battery pack and mouse and I can go for days without finding a wall outlet.",5,positive,The person likes that his wife uses this laptop to listen to Spotify.,Spotify on her computer.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/2ab41bbdd5453acdcb55da4d7c03428e,2021-04-09T11:18:46,She uses the Chrome and Spotify on her computer.,ListenAction,Action Exist

I will try to cover the things that I^ve learned. As far as hardware this Pixelbook Go is nearly perfect. It has to be one of the lightest and thinnest laptops I have ever owned and it^s the ultimate in portability. It has a solid medal case and the bottom has ripples that make it super easy to grip. Even though its light its very fast due to the solid state hard drive and processor. I wouldn^t attempt any serious video processing but for the average home or student it should be fine. The display is full 1080 and its sharp and bright and the touch screen is very responsive. The keyboard is lighted which is a plus but the keys are dead flat so it^s tough to find the home keys by feel. There are three total ports, two are USB-C style ports and the other is a headphone jack. The USB-C is used to charge the laptop and it has a fast charge feature. The supplied power cube is larger than most and may present an issue because it plugs directly into the outlet vs being a corded power brick. The battery life on this Chromebook is listed as 12 hours and I have gotten close to that number. There are two front firing speakers alongside the keyboard that produce sound way beyond what you would expect from a laptop! The built in wireless is fast and my throughput on my wireless is what I would expect. The Bluetooth quickly found my mouse and ear buds without issue. Using Chrome OS was a bit of a transition from Windows. Everything is browser based versus menu based so you need to learn the correct urls to get the information that you want. For example if you want to get the system information you need to open Chrome and type chrome://system. And then you either read through the webpage or use the search feature to find whatever you want to see. There are some simple things that are still menu based like the display settings, volume, wireless setting and a few others. To access the programs you select a Circle in the left hand corner and it brings up your apps. Everything seems to be there its just a totally different way of accessing it from a Windows system or even from an Android phone. A major plus for this Pixelbook is the inclusion of Google docs which I was very happy to see could handle any Word or Excel file I tried to open. After a quick search I learned how to use Chrome to access the files on my home network. Natively Chrome is set up to get files from the cloud and not your local network. The good news is that there is a lot of information on the web on how to use Chrome OS. Google also included a photo viewer that is super fast in loading and includes enough features to make it worthwhile. Because Chrome OS is app based there are tons of applications that are available. I downloaded the Spotify app and was able to really enjoy my playlist using the speakers on this Pixelbook. Overall its kind of an adventure transitioning from Windows to Chrome OS but this Pixelbook has made it fun and worthwhile. The typical user who uses this Pixelbook for playing media and using the typical apps or games will have no problem adjusting to Chrome OS. As I said this Pixelbook is close to being perfect. There are a few things that I wish they would improve. I am not a fan of the keyboard as I stated above but its not a show stopper. I was worried about the small amount of physical hard drive space included in the system. The push is for everyone to use the cloud but because this Pixelbook is so perfect for travel getting access to the cloud could be an issue. To avoid this issue I purchased a 500 gig external SSD that is USB-C compatible and that solved the concern. Lastly I wish Google would have include some additional utility apps like an equalizer for example.

I will try to cover the things that I^ve learned. As far as hardware this Pixelbook Go is nearly perfect. It has to be one of the lightest and thinnest laptops I have ever owned and it^s the ultimate in portability. It has a solid medal case and the bottom has ripples that make it super easy to grip. Even though its light its very fast due to the solid state hard drive and processor. I wouldn^t attempt any serious video processing but for the average home or student it should be fine. The display is full 1080 and its sharp and bright and the touch screen is very responsive.

I don""t love the all black color because I feel like it looks cheaper and is less quality than it really is. I would have personally preferred a sliver/chrome color. The top is smooth and the bottom has grooves on it. I think that the grooves are supposed to help with stability so it doesn""t slide off of surfaces because it doesn""t have any feet on the bottom. It""s super lightweight and thin. The Google Pixelbook Go weighs just over 2 pounds and it""s half an inch in thickness. It""s built with travel and portability in mind. The keyboard has a nice typing feel to it and it""s backlight for easy visibility. I""m super picky about keyboards and I like this one a lot. The touch screen gives you more versatility and control. The screen does not fold back all the way to convert into a tablet though. That is also another feature I would have preferred. I also own the 12.3"" Touchscreen Chromebook Pixelbook and that one does so I""m somewhat surprised this one doesn""t since it""s made for on the go. The USB-C ports are on either side for easy access for charging. There is also a 3.5mm headphone jack on the left side. Start up- This couldn""t have been any easier. I unwrapped the box, opened up the Google Pixelbook Go. It booted up with about 70% power. It asks you right away to connect to your wifi, it updated to the latest version and sets your voice for recognition with Google Assistant and then it""s ready to go.The streaming on the Google Pixelboook Go has been flawless. We don""t have cable but only streaming services (Amazon Prime, HBO Go, AT&T Now) and the typical YouTube videos my kids watch and we haven""t had any lagging or buffering the videos that we""ve watched so far. The picture quality is is great with the HD screen. The bigger adjustment for me personally are the Chrome web apps and extensions. They""re a regular program that runs in the Chrome Browser, to keep everything running fast and the files are safe. Some apps are already loaded on the Chromebook and there are more offered in the Chrome Web store. My kids use the the Google docs and sheets in school on a daily basis and this works seamlessly with that. I appreciate the ease and ability to do homework at home with no problems. I would highly recommend the Google Pixelbook Go to anyone looking for a great reliable laptop for yourself or a student. I have been really happy with the Google Pixelbook Chromebooks we own.

3669,3669,1329,"Google - Pixelbook Go 13.3"" Touch-Screen Chromebook - Intel Core m3 - 8GB Memory - 64GB Solid State Drive - Just Black",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/GA00519_US,ViewAction,Person,Universal,ScreenQuality,"Take the best features of Chromebooks, wrap them in a premium build with stellar battery life, and outfit them with an extremely good audio and visual experience, and you get a Pixelbook Go.The ""Go"" in the product name is embodied in excellent battery life and fantastic build quality. On a single charge, you can comfortably use this for half a day or more with no fear of the computer dying on you. What""s even better is the deceptively good build. The Pixelbook Go is constructed from a metal frame that gets a textured finish for added grip that feels durable and reliable. One of the biggest drawbacks with Chromebooks has generally been the compromises made on materials to drive costs down. Well, this model cuts in the opposite direction and offers excellent material design for a competitive price. The underside is ribbed to provide for easy transport and to prevent sliding, yet made from durable metal to withstand shocks and occasional drops. This device simply feels comfortable to hold, and is lightweight enough to be eminently transportable. Dropping this in a laptop bag made me think I was carrying a tablet around instead of a computer!The hinge is also satisfyingly strong and will clearly last years of use. The lid, or display half, is similarly solid and doesn""t produce any worrisome creaks or flex.Using this outdoors really illustrates how great the display can be. The auto-brightness settings can be extremely aggressive, but with a few presses of the Brightness key you can guarantee legibility in all sunlight conditions. The viewing angles are excellent as well, which gives the Pixelbook Go an advantage over 90 percent of the Chromebooks on the market.What really surprised me was how great the audio experience is. I""ve been cycling through film trailers to test just how well this little computer can produce audio, and I""m truly amazed. There are two speakers running alongside the keyboard on the Pixelbook Go. To see them, you might not think they""d be that powerful, but they can really reproduce TV-quality sound. I can even pick up stereo mixing as sounds from a Godzilla trailer transit from the right to the left! This is a feature even pricey Windows laptops generally struggle with, so I""m pleasantly surprised. There""s also a headphone jack, so commuters or students using this in a library can enjoy the great sound without being a nuisance.They keyboard and track pad are excellent as well. They keys may feel a bit ""plastic-y"" at first, but you""ll change your mind when you start typing with them. I""m actually typing this sentence right now with the Pixelbook Go, and I can testify that the keyboard has excellent responsiveness, the height of the keys provides for great travel, and you can type with a higher degree of precision than you would at first think. The track pad, at first, also seemed to have kind of a squishy quality to it, but I""m now seeing that it""s engineered to prevent against accidental presses. For once, the heel of my hand isn""t activating a menu option of shutting down a web page!The only negative about the screen is the slightly oily quality it has on close inspection. This, I""m sure, comes from the touch screen capability built into the display (yes, the display is a touch screen). You have to be really close to notice, so this is more of a quibble than a problem, but it""s something display perfectionists should be aware of.The software offerings also really show how Chrome OS has matured as a platform, and the integration with Google services makes for a seamless experience for any veteran Android user. A simple click on the Circle icon on the bottom left and you can access your key applications. Access to Google Play apps means users have a surfeit of good programs to choose from, and the ability to use Microsoft programs (I just touched up a resume in Word before writing this) means that work-oriented users won""t be disappointed. The on-board integration of Google Assistant, with its own dedicated key, is pretty cool as well. Simply hitting a key and talking to your computer certainly feels futuristic, even if voice assistants in general still have room to develop. Android users envious of Apple""s integration of phone and computer services should note that the Pixelbook Go enables the same functionality. Get your texts on your computer, unlock your computer with your phone, and see who""s calling from your Pixelbook screen - all pretty awesome.Under the settings menu, there""s even an option to run Linux (in beta). This could be a potential game-changer down the road. The thought of doing command line work on a Pixelbook , and working within a Linux IDE, would silence the some of the last complaints from Windows or Apple users.Processing speed and RAM are also more than sufficient. Power users like to scrutinize specs carefully, but even the basic configuration, running a lighter OS as it does, offers stellar performance. No lag, instant web page loads, and the ability to utilize productivity apps equals a highly recommended regular- or business-use machine. In fact, because it""s not weighed down by features most people won""""t use, performance is guaranteed to remain strong for years to come. Even Apple computers slow down over time. Plus, regular security updates ensure a higher degree of safety than other platforms offer.In short, this is a high-end Chromebook that absolutely will not disappoint you, and is well worth the price. This is not a 2-in-1 design, but for all that""s on offer with the Pixelbook Go, you won""t care.Strongly recommended for all general users.

The school actually recommended cheaper brands/models, but we thought it would be worthwhile to buy something nicer and went with the Pixelbook Go.  We purchased two and they have both been nothing but trouble.They regularly shut down unexpectedly while using them.  One of them stopped charging and required a hard reset.  The other wouldn""t boot, also requiring a hard reset.  On one occasion, one of them seemed to lose all data after logging in.  You could still log into the accounts, but it was like logging in for the first time each time.  Local files would be gone and the account would re-establish itself after logging in.  This issue required a ""power wash"" to resolve, which set the machine back to it""s factory default state.It""s been 5 months since we first purchased these, so I""m pretty sure we""re stuck with them.  I""d return them if I could.  For as much as these cost, I wish I would""ve bought a Mac or Windows-based laptop.

It made most the functions and settings on the Pixelbook useless. Launcher wouldn^t work. The chat heads were there but weren^t. I couldn^t go into settings. I had to reboot or log out and log back in just to have some functionality. Then if someone messaged me while I was trying to fix it, BOOM problem again. After a frustrating 20 minutes I managed to uninstall it. I know this not directly associated with Google but it does show that some of the Apps they allow you to install aren^t quite Chrome OS ready. The Chrome OS software has a bit of a learning curve. Keyboard shortcuts are a bit much, like having to hit 4 buttons for a shortcut doesn^t seem that efficient (Alt-Shift-Ctrl-? Is used just to bring up the shortcut menu). The trackpad is nice and responsive and the shortcuts or gestures are pretty easy to learn. TL:DR / In a nutshellPros:Light/thin/Ultra portable - Easy to carry around with gripped backsideBattery life is fantastic and doesn^t heat upKeyboard and touch screen combo is niceSpeakers and video playback are of exceptional quality!Chrome OS system runs fast and smooth, and is well securedConsNon-Google apps can be wonky Learning curve if not used to Chrome OS (I recommend watching some videos and use the Help)Random screen flicker (might be isolated to my unit) Feels like some functions don^t work well at times. For example the Launcher and Settings have been unresponsive and the touchscreen freezes at times. Could be easily fixed with software update.Overall, it took some time to get adjusted at first, but then after a couple of days I really started becoming more familiar with the OS and how well everything works. I^m impressed with the hardware design and the more I use the Pixelbook the more I like it.",5,positive,"The person likes to stream football games or music on this laptop due to its loud speakers"" sound","Streaming movies, football games, and music have all sounded exceptionally well for something as small as this.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/1ada3ddd71feb2d74d14e9456c76671d,2021-05-06T10:04:14,"Streaming movies, football games, and music have all sounded exceptionally well for something as small as this.",StreamAction,Action Exist

I already use the Pixel phone so I""m somewhat in the ecosystem. If you use an Android phone, you can use it to unlock you Pixelbook Go since there""s no fingerprint sensor to unlock or to use for payments. With heavy usage, the battery lasts all day for me. With light usage daily, I can go about 3 days without charging. This is awesome because I haven""t had this experience with any other computer platform, Mac, Windows, or even previous Chromebooks. While the display is touchscreen, it doesn""t support the Google Pencil. You can easily open this with one finger with no problem. It""s very lightweight and feels premium and not cheap like some of its competitor""s chromebook options. There""s been complaints of there being no CAPS lock but there is. You""ll just press the launcher key along with ALT.  Typing on the keyboard is quiet. The keyboard is smooth and no issues. I like typing on this keyboard. This says a lot for me as I have returned computers due to the way the keyboard feels when typing. The Pixelbook Go supports quick charge, so no need to worry about that when on the go and needing it to charge quick.It has two USB-C ports and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The upward facing speakers on each side of the keyboard remind me of the older MacBook Pro and current MacBook Air speakers. The speakers sound great with music or watching a quick show or movie when on a flight. I""ve paired mine with a USB-C hub, so that I can connect my ultrafit USB thumb drive where I can save documents and access other saved content. You also have the option to use Google Drive to save content.I was able to easily access my network print with my Pixelbook Go connected to the same network.You know have the option to use Linux on your Pixelbook Go without having to boot in to another drive.

Google did an absolutely amazing job on designing and building this computer. The backside of the GO has this really nice ribbed construction and that""s meant to add grip for when you grab it and GO!The 13 inch display is 1080p on my model (Core i5) and watching Netflix and Playing games you really notice how nice it actually is! The colors pop and it has a nice amount of detail, especially when watching 4k content! Along with the vibrant display you have these insanely loud but immersive speakers. They add a nice touch and increase the overall experience for media consumption.The Trackpad is also very nice, they use a smooth piece of glass that handles all of your gestures with ease and fluidity. Just above that you have their popular HUSH keyboard. Now I will say the typing experience on this computer is the best I have ever had. The keys have nice travel and are soft on every press. Again its something you will have to try for yourself but Its one of my favorite things about this computer besides the speakers!Now this Pixelbook is super light and very thin at just a half inch, it really is something I wouldn""t mind taking with me everywhere because of its small footprint!Now this is my first Chromebook experience but I have to say that the simplicity of just signing in with your google account and from there everything is linked to the Pixelbook just like that. there""s no need to setup any of the apps like google drive or chrome browser with all of your bookmarks. Also the Docs and Sheets word processing apps are great too! everything will be synced and always backed up, you will never need to worry about transferring from computer to computer, just sign in and GO!Overall I have to say I think its an amazing machine and if its within your budget, I say def give it a try and see how you like it, Heck you might even fall in Love with it!**We just did a video review on the Pixelbook Go and encourage you to check it out on YouTube.

I made that mistake and paid the price - $650 in this case :)Like many people these days, I lost my job due to COVID and suddenly realized I don""t have a decent laptop for my job search & the certification exams I was planning to complete. Reading the reviews about the fast performance and sleek design, I went for the pixelbook go. Another main reason was the high price & long lead time for the good windows laptops at the time of my purchase. To be honest, I don""t have anything against this Pixelbook. It is just that I feel it is overpriced considering several of Chrome OS ""s limitations.  While you can overcome issues like the keyboard shortcuts you""re used to in Windows in a few days below are my main concerns:1. Many of the software is not designed to be run in Chrome OS, try taking an oracle certification from Pearson Vue or some of the other online exams. They recognize only Windows or Mac OS.  When people are sitting at home trying to learn new skills this doesn""t help.2. Forget about using MS Office (at least the full version).  They say you can edit word docs but that is maybe only for a simple text-only document. The header in my resume was gone, the alignment was terrible when I opened the word document in google""s in-built docs and while editing the app crashed several times. You can install Microsoft word from playstore but that will not allow you to edit, it is read-only. Even if you buy the office 365, you will not get the full features in the android version. So good luck in quickly editing resumes in word format.3. If you^re used to regular laptops with USB & HDMI ports, please be aware this one has only two USB-C ports. For someone like me who works with two monitors, with one having HDMI and another only VGA it was a nightmare figuring out the right combination and getting a USB hub.I only started using my pixelbook in the second week and by the time I understood the limitations, the return period (15 days) was over. I spoke to the customer support and they wanted me to try talking to the store. Even though I only wanted a store credit and offered to buy a much higher priced laptop the store was not ready.

The privacy display is very bright, though not quite as bright as you""d expect considering the 1000 nits claim. I""m guessing the polarizer film on top reduces the outright brightness. Compared to my chromebook, it was noticeably brighter but not significantly (the Chromebook is an Asus C302 so the ratings would indicate that the HP would be extremely bright by comparison, which isn""t the case side by side).Unfortunately, the brightness levels not being up to advertised isn""t where the display issues end (brightness and color are still pretty good, don""t get me wrong). The viewing angles on this device are AWFUL. So bad in fact, that the solid backgrounds and windows will display significantly more brightness in the center than areas of the screen around the edges when the screen is pointed directly at your eyes. Even just nodding/turning your head slightly will totally change the amount of light that reaches your eyes. For those looking for privacy,  this may be a tradeoff worth making but I personally bought this device for it""s advertised 1,000 nits peak brightness, 100% sRGB coverage, and 120hz refresh rate. Touching on the last part, this is also a bit misleading. The display can""t reach anywhere near 120hz (it must be using PWM flickering or black frame insertion for the privacy screen feature and therefore may technically be refreshing at 120hz despite capping at 60fps). I went through the trouble of installing CRU 1.4 (a utility that allows for custom refresh rate and resolution combinations) and the display managed to hit 75hz @1080p reliably without any artifacts but didn""t even remotely make it to the advertised 120hz. The display i received also had a ton of backlight bleed and uniformity issues along the edges (not just the privacy filter issues I described). All in all, this display is definitely not recommended to anyone aside from those who absolutely need the privacy feature (which only seems to lower the brightness levels from what I saw). My guess is my unit had the 2nd generation privacy display as these issues accurately describes this panel and not the newer 3rd generation versions which improved these issues.I only used the laptop for all of 30 minutes before deciding to wipe the drive and return in (which I""ll be doing tomorrow). My unit had display issue where the touch screen seemed like it was pressing into something in the chassis on the right side and caused a strange discoloration on the area surrounding it, this became VERY apparent when touching the screen in this area. Terrible quality control on HPs part at least regarding the display. The rest of the laptop is awesome honestly, the keys don""t seem to give quite as tactile of a click as I""d like but they offer good travel and I feel I""d be fairly proficient typing on this device as the keys are well spaced with nice key caps. There is an additional row of page nav keys on the far right that would take some getting used to though and I found I""d click them instead of the enter/backspace/escape keys out of habit but this is something that would probably go away with time. The touch pad is good and offers a solid click mechanism, it has a good size even if it could be a tad taller (it""s plenty wide though). The surface has a strange texture to it that I didnt appreciate as it made slow scrolling difficult. Quick swipes worked well enough but smaller/slower movements created a drag on my fingertips that would cause them to skip rather than slide. It almost has a matte like surface, which is strange for a trackpad in my opinion. The rest of the device""s fit and finish are top notch and feel VERY premium. I wasn""t sure about the color but it was the only option at best buy (HP offers a white version on their site and had offered a black variant as well with the older one with the 10th gen ice lake chip) but it was actually quite nice. The gold isn""t gaudy and has a nice professionalism to it in person that i wasn""t expecting. On a pure white background in the promotional materials, it looks a bit different and seemed like it might stand out more than I""d prefer but I think this is just due to the contrast of the white background they have it on.The speakers are pretty great, outright volume isn""t ridiculously loud but loud enough. Luckily the speakers don""t get tinny or washed out at all at maximum volume. They""re  awesome for the size of the device and are much better than those found on my chromebook by comparison. Bass response is balanced and manages to be surprising despite the small chassis of the device. Performance was snappy and everything loaded quickly in my short time using the device. This is to be expected, considering the 1165g7 is about as good as it gets on a thin and light right now. 4700u (and even more so, the 4800u if there would be devices offered in the US with this chip) options may be a tad better with multi core specific applications but for day to day tasks, the tiger lake i7 is the best around from what I""ve seen in direct comparisons. The iGPU also is excellent, though this is something I didn""t test. I did specifically want this chip for it""s graphical performance though,  the Intel Xe graphics, specifically the 96cu unit found in this chip, is currently the most powerful iGPU on the planet and offers the ability to play casual games and even some more demanding ones (albeit on lower settings). This GPU really had me keen on this device in particular since the advertised 120hz display seemed ideal for playing less demanding titles at above 60fps in an ultra portable form factor. Combine that with next gen consoles supporting game streaming and you could imagine this device being quite the bargain for someone looking for a thin and light that can play some games here and there. Unfortunately, it seems Razer will continue to be the only manufacturer offering an ultra portable capable of the aforementioned with their 120hz blade stealth (that and maybe an iPad pro/Galaxy tab S7 if you""d consider these to be in the same category). The fingerprint authentication is solid, it only faltered one time in my short time using it. I didn""t test the webcam or much else (like drive speeds or intensive workloads/benchmarks but these will be available online eventually) on the device because I was just so disappointed by my units display issues. I was going to give the device a chance because it was a hell of a bargain but my chromebook is still doing well enough to the point where I""ll just save the money and buy further down the line as devices wil only continue to get better with time.All in all, the device is a great value and a solid overall option for anyone looking for a convertible with enough processing capabilities to be a borderline workstation in a pinch.

The viewing angles on this device are AWFUL. So bad in fact, that the solid backgrounds and windows will display significantly more brightness in the center than areas of the screen around the edges when the screen is pointed directly at your eyes.

Touching on the last part, this is also a bit misleading. The display can""t reach anywhere near 120hz (it must be using PWM flickering or black frame insertion for the privacy screen feature and therefore may technically be refreshing at 120hz despite capping at 60fps). I went through the trouble of installing CRU 1.4 (a utility that allows for custom refresh rate and resolution combinations) and the display managed to hit 75hz @1080p reliably without any artifacts but didn""t even remotely make it to the advertised 120hz.

All in all, this display is definitely not recommended to anyone aside from those who absolutely need the privacy feature (which only seems to lower the brightness levels from what I saw).

My unit had display issue where the touch screen seemed like it was pressing into something in the chassis on the right side and caused a strange discoloration on the area surrounding it, this became VERY apparent when touching the screen in this area.

5356,5356,1498,"HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Evo Platform - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Pale Gold",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/13m_bd0023dx,ScrollAction,Person,Universal,iGPU,"This laptop seems like a fantastic all around package, especially for the price. The privacy display is very bright, though not quite as bright as you""d expect considering the 1000 nits claim. I""m guessing the polarizer film on top reduces the outright brightness. Compared to my chromebook, it was noticeably brighter but not significantly (the Chromebook is an Asus C302 so the ratings would indicate that the HP would be extremely bright by comparison, which isn""t the case side by side).Unfortunately, the brightness levels not being up to advertised isn""t where the display issues end (brightness and color are still pretty good, don""t get me wrong). The viewing angles on this device are AWFUL. So bad in fact, that the solid backgrounds and windows will display significantly more brightness in the center than areas of the screen around the edges when the screen is pointed directly at your eyes. Even just nodding/turning your head slightly will totally change the amount of light that reaches your eyes. For those looking for privacy,  this may be a tradeoff worth making but I personally bought this device for it""s advertised 1,000 nits peak brightness, 100% sRGB coverage, and 120hz refresh rate. Touching on the last part, this is also a bit misleading. The display can""t reach anywhere near 120hz (it must be using PWM flickering or black frame insertion for the privacy screen feature and therefore may technically be refreshing at 120hz despite capping at 60fps). I went through the trouble of installing CRU 1.4 (a utility that allows for custom refresh rate and resolution combinations) and the display managed to hit 75hz @1080p reliably without any artifacts but didn""t even remotely make it to the advertised 120hz. The display i received also had a ton of backlight bleed and uniformity issues along the edges (not just the privacy filter issues I described). All in all, this display is definitely not recommended to anyone aside from those who absolutely need the privacy feature (which only seems to lower the brightness levels from what I saw). My guess is my unit had the 2nd generation privacy display as these issues accurately describes this panel and not the newer 3rd generation versions which improved these issues.I only used the laptop for all of 30 minutes before deciding to wipe the drive and return in (which I""ll be doing tomorrow). My unit had display issue where the touch screen seemed like it was pressing into something in the chassis on the right side and caused a strange discoloration on the area surrounding it, this became VERY apparent when touching the screen in this area. Terrible quality control on HPs part at least regarding the display. The rest of the laptop is awesome honestly, the keys don""t seem to give quite as tactile of a click as I""d like but they offer good travel and I feel I""d be fairly proficient typing on this device as the keys are well spaced with nice key caps. There is an additional row of page nav keys on the far right that would take some getting used to though and I found I""d click them instead of the enter/backspace/escape keys out of habit but this is something that would probably go away with time. The touch pad is good and offers a solid click mechanism, it has a good size even if it could be a tad taller (it""s plenty wide though). The surface has a strange texture to it that I didnt appreciate as it made slow scrolling difficult. Quick swipes worked well enough but smaller/slower movements created a drag on my fingertips that would cause them to skip rather than slide. It almost has a matte like surface, which is strange for a trackpad in my opinion. The rest of the device""s fit and finish are top notch and feel VERY premium. I wasn""t sure about the color but it was the only option at best buy (HP offers a white version on their site and had offered a black variant as well with the older one with the 10th gen ice lake chip) but it was actually quite nice. The gold isn""t gaudy and has a nice professionalism to it in person that i wasn""t expecting. On a pure white background in the promotional materials, it looks a bit different and seemed like it might stand out more than I""d prefer but I think this is just due to the contrast of the white background they have it on.The speakers are pretty great, outright volume isn""t ridiculously loud but loud enough. Luckily the speakers don""t get tinny or washed out at all at maximum volume. They""re  awesome for the size of the device and are much better than those found on my chromebook by comparison. Bass response is balanced and manages to be surprising despite the small chassis of the device. Performance was snappy and everything loaded quickly in my short time using the device. This is to be expected, considering the 1165g7 is about as good as it gets on a thin and light right now. 4700u (and even more so, the 4800u if there would be devices offered in the US with this chip) options may be a tad better with multi core specific applications but for day to day tasks, the tiger lake i7 is the best around from what I""ve seen in direct comparisons. The iGPU also is excellent, though this is something I didn""t test. I did specifically want this chip for it""s graphical performance though,  the Intel Xe graphics, specifically the 96cu unit found in this chip, is currently the most powerful iGPU on the planet and offers the ability to play casual games and even some more demanding ones (albeit on lower settings). This GPU really had me keen on this device in particular since the advertised 120hz display seemed ideal for playing less demanding titles at above 60fps in an ultra portable form factor. Combine that with next gen consoles supporting game streaming and you could imagine this device being quite the bargain for someone looking for a thin and light that can play some games here and there. Unfortunately, it seems Razer will continue to be the only manufacturer offering an ultra portable capable of the aforementioned with their 120hz blade stealth (that and maybe an iPad pro/Galaxy tab S7 if you""d consider these to be in the same category). The fingerprint authentication is solid, it only faltered one time in my short time using it. I didn""t test the webcam or much else (like drive speeds or intensive workloads/benchmarks but these will be available online eventually) on the device because I was just so disappointed by my units display issues. I was going to give the device a chance because it was a hell of a bargain but my chromebook is still doing well enough to the point where I""ll just save the money and buy further down the line as devices wil only continue to get better with time.All in all, the device is a great value and a solid overall option for anyone looking for a convertible with enough processing capabilities to be a borderline workstation in a pinch.

The box included the laptop and the power adapter. Physical setup was pretty easy. Cortana prompted me through it all. The volume was initially a bit loud. I had to turn it down.The touchpad is logically divided with the left side being a left-click and the right side being the right-click.I have a Microsoft account and use Office 365 so it was easy to connect to OneDrive and office apps. I was hoping to use Windows Face Hello, but it appears to not support that. I went in to Settings and it said the laptop didn^t have the right camera to support this, so I setup Windows Hello Fingerprint and PIN. I always register multiple fingers on both hands to allow for bandaids and other recognition issuesSetup seemed to really want me to sign in to Dropbox. I have a Dropbox account, so I did that.The laptop comes with a 30 day trial for McAfee, but I use BitDefender, so I made that switch.After the initial setup, I installed a few apps that I use on my Windows PCs. One is the Axis Camera Companion V4. For some reason, I had a lot of trouble getting that app to work on this laptop. I tried to run the HP Support Assistant to make sure I had all of the latest drivers, but that also would not run. I followed the instructions to restart my PC and ultimately to in-install and re-install Support Assistant. That fixed the SA problem. After that I ran SA and found three drivers that required updates. I updated the WLAN driver, Intel HD Graphics Driver and Realtek CardReader Driver. I was eventually able to get the application running.I really like the buttons (function keys) for controlling the microphone and camera. Just like the speakers, I can turn them off with the touch of a button.The HD display is very crisp and clear. Audio has nice fidelity, but lacks bass, most likely due to limitations in the size of the laptop enclosure. However, I did find both audio and video provided for a very nice streaming experience for me.

I""ll get right down to business. Let us start off with my initial thoughts. For anyone who has been keeping an eye on the competition with team blue & team red we know what has been happening as of late so there isn""t a need to fan those flames. With one of HP latest releases this Envy is solid all around and I""ll explain in detail as we delver further into the review. Upon opening the box you don""t get a fancy experience or anything like that but that is alright because it is the product itself that has to impress me not the box. The fact that HP decided to create a different colored laptop I can certainly appreciate that it is certainly a nice shade of gold but nothing flashy because it still has that metal looking finish to it. It is nice to see HP offer something other than the default gunmetal grey/silver.:::Build Quality:::The new Envy 13 has a nice bit of heft to it and feels solid in the hand. When you first open the laptop the hinge feels sturdy and solid and there is no wobble or creaking noises. That is a plus because this isn""t a poorly built product. I do not know if the correct term is all in one but the hinge rotates fully so it can be used in tent or tablet mode for drawing or taking notes.The keyboard is nice and has a good amount of spacing and the keys feel solid and has plenty of travel. the keys do not stick, they are not mushy or anything horrible like the new Mac keyboards. It feels good and has a normal springy feel nothing too crazy. The backlighting is adjustable and gets plenty bright so that you can actually see in a dark room, and the opposite can be said as well with the keys can be dimmed to a comfortable level and also to conserve battery life as well so there is a nice balance. I was pleasantly surprised with the webcam and I do not mean the actual webcam because it is a decent webcam and will get the job done. The webcam privacy cover has its own dedicated button to toggle the cover so that you have privacy which is essential in this day and age.The screen is bright it isn""t as bright as the premium televisions on the market but it will get bright enough to meet your needs, the viewing angles are great and If I am not mistaken this is an IPS display. The screen is also touchscreen and supports pen input as well. I tested my Envy with an existing HP stylus I had laying around from a previous HP laptop I own. I am not sure why my other laptop has a problem with One Note but thankfully that is not the case here I suspect perhaps a driver issue of some sort. The stylus experience is what you would expect from a device like this and is pleasant to use and will be helpful to students or artists or whomever has a use for a device like this. It is comparable to using a surface device after it is running on Windows OS.:::Specifications::Alright so we have touched on the aesthetics and build quality of the device let us touch on the specifications briefly. I will not go and repeat verbatim what the specs are because they are clearly listed on the page. I love the direction that PC manufacturers are headed in where we are getting SSD as the norm and this Envy has a respectable 512GB of storage. I am impressed with that because you can do quite a bit with that amount of storage and of course you can use the SD card slot I suppose for more storage or even an external drive. Now being that I have not went an attempted to open this up I went to crucial website and checked to see if this could be upgraded and provided that the RAM and SSD are not soldered then upgrading your memory and and ram should be possible. You could hypothetically swap the SSD for a bigger drive.Now my only complaint is the measly 8GB of RAM now that may be sufficient for most but I find that for the CPU configuration of an 11th gen quad core eight thread CPU 8GB won""t be sufficient for more demanding applications. But again I will do some research or take it to geek squad and see if this device has user replaceable RAM & SSD. Heck I may even open it up myself and peek under the hood.According to CPUZ theoretically you can install up to 128GB of RAM but there are only two slots on the board. I do not know if anyone actually makes memory modules of that size and I would not spend the money to install that on a laptop either to me that just doesn""t make sense. Again should this device support user replaceable components then I will most definitely swap out the current 8GB of DDR4 ram for 16GB. That will be the sweet spot on this device or at least for me and my usage it will be. The memory is running at a frequency of 732.3 MHz (1:11) and is single channel.Battery life now I feel that battery life has gotten better overtime I have the power slider on the third notch out of four and with mixed usage I am averaging approximately 7 and a half hours which isn""t bad at all but that is me actually using the laptop for more than word processing. I find myself running folding @ home sometimes, photoshop and some media consumption. I am sure that it is possible to squeeze more out of the battery but this is just my unique experience. The speakers are made by B&O so the sound is pretty good for a laptop HP has gotten better with their audio game as time has passed. While it will not blow you away like a home theater would that is expected because this isn""t for that kind of usage. The speakers get plenty loud and do not sound like a hollow tin can. There is some nice oomph to them. :::Pros & Con""s:::Pros:- Beautiful gold finish- Compact & sturdy - built in fingerprint sensor (works fast too)- touch & pen input- better than average battery life- decent amount of full sized ports & thunderbolt (I&O)Cons:- Measly 8GB of RAM :::Closing thoughts:::Still with me? If so thanks for reading so let me say that this is my favorite laptop that HP has released thus far. A lot of folk have been head over heels for some of the other line of devices like the Spectre series but this works well for me I just love nearly everything about this device. The camera, speakers, keyboard & trackpad, screen, I&O and battery life make this a solid product. It certainly will not replace my desktop but this can do almost as much and is compact and is great for almost everyone. :::TL:DR:::If you like big things in little packages then please check this device out. It has the latest offerings and is fast enough to keep up with you and you will not have to be tethered to the will. This HP laptop is truly a small powerhouse.",5,positive,The person likes the hinge rotation of this laptop to draw in tablet-mode,drawing,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/43e6dca35fb8824cced8820948c09aca,2021-02-21T15:14:14,I do not know if the correct term is all in one but the hinge rotates fully so it can be used in tent or tablet mode for drawing or taking notes.The keyboard is nice and has a good amount of spacing and the keys feel solid and has plenty of travel.,DrawAction,Action Exist

For anyone who has been keeping an eye on the competition with team blue & team red we know what has been happening as of late so there isn""t a need to fan those flames. With one of HP latest releases this Envy is solid all around and I""ll explain in detail as we delver further into the review. Upon opening the box you don""t get a fancy experience or anything like that but that is alright because it is the product itself that has to impress me not the box. The fact that HP decided to create a different colored laptop I can certainly appreciate that it is certainly a nice shade of gold but nothing flashy because it still has that metal looking finish to it. It is nice to see HP offer something other than the default gunmetal grey/silver.:::Build Quality:::The new Envy 13 has a nice bit of heft to it and feels solid in the hand. When you first open the laptop the hinge feels sturdy and solid and there is no wobble or creaking noises. That is a plus because this isn""t a poorly built product. I do not know if the correct term is all in one but the hinge rotates fully so it can be used in tent or tablet mode for drawing or taking notes.The keyboard is nice and has a good amount of spacing and the keys feel solid and has plenty of travel. the keys do not stick, they are not mushy or anything horrible like the new Mac keyboards. It feels good and has a normal springy feel nothing too crazy. The backlighting is adjustable and gets plenty bright so that you can actually see in a dark room, and the opposite can be said as well with the keys can be dimmed to a comfortable level and also to conserve battery life as well so there is a nice balance. I was pleasantly surprised with the webcam and I do not mean the actual webcam because it is a decent webcam and will get the job done. The webcam privacy cover has its own dedicated button to toggle the cover so that you have privacy which is essential in this day and age.The screen is bright it isn""t as bright as the premium televisions on the market but it will get bright enough to meet your needs, the viewing angles are great and If I am not mistaken this is an IPS display. The screen is also touchscreen and supports pen input as well. I tested my Envy with an existing HP stylus I had laying around from a previous HP laptop I own. I am not sure why my other laptop has a problem with One Note but thankfully that is not the case here I suspect perhaps a driver issue of some sort. The stylus experience is what you would expect from a device like this and is pleasant to use and will be helpful to students or artists or whomever has a use for a device like this. It is comparable to using a surface device after it is running on Windows OS.:::Specifications::Alright so we have touched on the aesthetics and build quality of the device let us touch on the specifications briefly. I will not go and repeat verbatim what the specs are because they are clearly listed on the page. I love the direction that PC manufacturers are headed in where we are getting SSD as the norm and this Envy has a respectable 512GB of storage. I am impressed with that because you can do quite a bit with that amount of storage and of course you can use the SD card slot I suppose for more storage or even an external drive. Now being that I have not went an attempted to open this up I went to crucial website and checked to see if this could be upgraded and provided that the RAM and SSD are not soldered then upgrading your memory and and ram should be possible. You could hypothetically swap the SSD for a bigger drive.Now my only complaint is the measly 8GB of RAM now that may be sufficient for most but I find that for the CPU configuration of an 11th gen quad core eight thread CPU 8GB won""t be sufficient for more demanding applications. But again I will do some research or take it to geek squad and see if this device has user replaceable RAM & SSD. Heck I may even open it up myself and peek under the hood.According to CPUZ theoretically you can install up to 128GB of RAM but there are only two slots on the board. I do not know if anyone actually makes memory modules of that size and I would not spend the money to install that on a laptop either to me that just doesn""t make sense. Again should this device support user replaceable components then I will most definitely swap out the current 8GB of DDR4 ram for 16GB. That will be the sweet spot on this device or at least for me and my usage it will be. The memory is running at a frequency of 732.3 MHz (1:11) and is single channel.Battery life now I feel that battery life has gotten better overtime I have the power slider on the third notch out of four and with mixed usage I am averaging approximately 7 and a half hours which isn""t bad at all but that is me actually using the laptop for more than word processing. I find myself running folding @ home sometimes, photoshop and some media consumption. I am sure that it is possible to squeeze more out of the battery but this is just my unique experience. The speakers are made by B&O so the sound is pretty good for a laptop HP has gotten better with their audio game as time has passed. While it will not blow you away like a home theater would that is expected because this isn""t for that kind of usage. The speakers get plenty loud and do not sound like a hollow tin can. There is some nice oomph to them. :::Pros & Con""s:::Pros:- Beautiful gold finish- Compact & sturdy - built in fingerprint sensor (works fast too)- touch & pen input- better than average battery life- decent amount of full sized ports & thunderbolt (I&O)Cons:- Measly 8GB of RAM :::Closing thoughts:::Still with me? If so thanks for reading so let me say that this is my favorite laptop that HP has released thus far. A lot of folk have been head over heels for some of the other line of devices like the Spectre series but this works well for me I just love nearly everything about this device. The camera, speakers, keyboard & trackpad, screen, I&O and battery life make this a solid product. It certainly will not replace my desktop but this can do almost as much and is compact and is great for almost everyone. :::TL:DR:::If you like big things in little packages then please check this device out. It has the latest offerings and is fast enough to keep up with you and you will not have to be tethered to the will. This HP laptop is truly a small powerhouse.",5,positive,The person likes the tablet function of this laptop to write notes.,taking notes.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/1768a05fed51a0afa96f88560347e8de,2021-02-21T15:15:24,I do not know if the correct term is all in one but the hinge rotates fully so it can be used in tent or tablet mode for drawing or taking notes.The keyboard is nice and has a good amount of spacing and the keys feel solid and has plenty of travel.,WriteAction,Action Exist

I come from mostly the Apple iOS world, but I use a Chromebook for general everyday use because it is inexpensive. So I^m not a Windows expert or tech guru. There is a ton of spec information already listed on the Best Buy page, I want to talk about the things that stand out to me as an average consumer.Right off the bat, this pale gold computer is so beautiful and modern. It looks fabulous with the optional backlit silver keyboard, which I do prefer as backlit, but it can easily be changed with a touch of the f4 button. Speaking of the keyboard, I love the many functions offered here. There are many well thought out features; a button to close the camera off, a button to turn off the microphone, and buttons on the right side of the keyboard to send you to home, page up, page down, and end. There is also a fingerprint reader so you can feel good about your computer security, as every time the screen sleeps, you use your fingerprint to get it working again. I also love the f1 privacy screen button, I can see using that when things get more normal and I get to fly again. That button is also good for making the screen darker in those instances like using the computer in a darkened room and don^t want the screen to be very bright. This is a touchscreen computer, but it doesn^t come with a stylus, which would be nice. I have been using a rubber ended pen, which is like an extended finger, but without the fingerprints. The screen itself is whoa, amazing. It is seamlessly beautiful, like looking at a tv. There aren^t any seemingly visible pixels, like on my Chromebook The colors displayed are so vibrant, it is easy to say that resolution is similar to a new tv set. The 360 degree hinge is what sets this computer apart from other regular computers, it can be used as a tablet when you need to, which is so versatile. When watching Netflix you can just prop it up like a little tv as the screen flips to be upright in any position. Pretty neat! I didn^t yet mention that the sound on this computer is also amazing, with dual Bang & Olufsen speakers built in.  Using this computer is pretty easy. Out of the box, just charge it up and you^re all set. I like that there is an orange light to show the battery is charging, and a white light to show that it is fully charged. I was easily able to hook up my two printers, which is something that can be a huge stress factor in getting a new computer.

There are many well thought out features; a button to close the camera off, a button to turn off the microphone, and buttons on the right side of the keyboard to send you to home, page up, page down, and end. There is also a fingerprint reader so you can feel good about your computer security, as every time the screen sleeps, you use your fingerprint to get it working again. I also love the f1 privacy screen button, I can see using that when things get more normal and I get to fly again. That button is also good for making the screen darker in those instances like using the computer in a darkened room and don^t want the screen to be very bright. This is a touchscreen computer, but it doesn^t come with a stylus, which would be nice. I have been using a rubber ended pen, which is like an extended finger, but without the fingerprints. The screen itself is whoa, amazing. It is seamlessly beautiful, like looking at a tv. There aren^t any seemingly visible pixels, like on my Chromebook The colors displayed are so vibrant, it is easy to say that resolution is similar to a new tv set. The 360 degree hinge is what sets this computer apart from other regular computers, it can be used as a tablet when you need to, which is so versatile. When watching Netflix you can just prop it up like a little tv as the screen flips to be upright in any position. Pretty neat! I didn^t yet mention that the sound on this computer is also amazing, with dual Bang & Olufsen speakers built in.  Using this computer is pretty easy. Out of the box, just charge it up and you^re all set. I like that there is an orange light to show the battery is charging, and a white light to show that it is fully charged. I was easily able to hook up my two printers, which is something that can be a huge stress factor in getting a new computer. But I was able to do it easily, and got my test print jobs without any issue, whew. All in all, a really nice computer in a beautiful package.",5,positive,The person likes to watch Netflix with this laptop in tablet-mode,When watching Netflix you can just prop it up like a little tv as the screen flips to be upright in any position.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/90aaef9ce4363dfe787dbba1ffa2c50e,2021-02-21T15:37:27,When watching Netflix you can just prop it up like a little tv as the screen flips to be upright in any position.,WatchAction,Action Exist

For me, it""s the perfect size and the build quality is more than adequate. Set-up was a breeze and I was able to hit the ground running in no time.  I have had zero issues with noise or heating up.  I am pleased with the full size keyboard and I have always liked HP""s touchpads.     I downloaded this little program from userbenchmark.com that allows you to run a series of tests  to see how your exact system performs and how it compares to other systems. Overall, I was very pleased with the results and the system performed as well as advertised. I would recommend to everyone to download that program and see how your system performs. My favorite  thing about this laptop is the screen. Wow is the best word that I can use to describe it. It is fantastic. I did not expect it to be this good. I owned a Dell 13.3"" with a 4K screen just before I bought this laptop. I also compared this screen, side by side, to a 4K screen on a HP Spectre. This screen simply just flat our looked better to me. I learned that I will never pay the $300 or whatever it is for a upcharge to a 4K screen when this 1920 x 1080 screen is available with BrightView and 1000 nits. Say 1000 nits out loud, that""s incredibly impressive and I had not even heard of that being available on any laptop.      Now, to the ""complaint"" department. Keep in mind I knew these things beforehand and I still purchased this laptop and I am very glad that I did.  Also, getting this for $750 allowed me to overlook some of the things I would have rather had. I am not sure that I would have paid $1000 for it.  My issue with the system is the lack of the ability to upgrade the RAM. I  understand that for most people, 8GB of RAM is enough. This system is equipped with a superfast, high tech 11th gen CPU with all the latest bells and whistles and built on the Evo platform that advertises speed and efficiency. With the restriction of only 8 GB of RAM, it doesn""t really allow the end user to fully utilize this laptop to its full potential. It""s almost like buying a Corvette with a V6 engine. To me, it""s a shame to solder the RAM on this model and feels a little petty of HP to do that. Lenovo is famous for that garbage and that""s why I will never purchase one of their products.  I really appreciate and like the fact that the HP team members take time to jump in and answer some of the questions that potential customers have about a product. A couple of weeks ago, a HP team member answered a question about Intel Optane Memory and said this laptop does have it. This laptop does not have that feature.  It would have been awesome to have it. I don""t understand how they could have gotten an important feature like that wrong. The Hello Windows with the fingerprint works great. Just ""program"" more than one finger.  I really really liked the Windows Hello with the facial recognition. It cracked me up every time I used it and I really wished this had the IR camera so facial recognition was possible.      One thing I really like about Best Buy and it really keeps my business is their customer friendly no hassle return policy. I give Best Buy 5 stars for that! I mention this because this is my 3rd laptop in 6 weeks trying to find what laptop suits me the best. I can tell you this is my last laptop till I wear it out or decide to upgrade. I simply love it and I am glad I bought it, especially for $750!     Even with having a few things that I would have liked to see different, I still gave it 5 stars.  You have to take the good with the bad and this laptop is an absolute tremendous value.",5,negative,"The person doesn""t like that this laptop doesn""t have an IR camera to unlock using face recognition.",I really wished this had the IR camera so facial recognition was possible,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/c24e14690afc923f5102ff0171f04256,2021-02-21T15:49:20,It cracked me up every time I used it and I really wished this had the IR camera so facial recognition was possible.,UnlockAction,Action Exist

The rubber strips that run the entirety of the base one in the front and one in the back also provide a lot of stability from movement. The 360 hinge is very solid and holds the screen right where you put it. I found it does take 2 hands to open the laptop from closed. The hinge tension is just enough that the base starts to lift off the working surface if trying to open with one hand. I actually prefer a more solid feeling hinge, so not a problem.The 11th generation Intel i7 is very fast and everything loads quickly with the SSD drive! Although the 3D graphics on this machine are not discrete, but the new Iris Xe graphics, you can do some 1080p gaming on this with decent FPS with the settings turned down a bit. I played Borderlands 2, World of Warcraft, Tomb Raider Anniversary Edition and they looked great and played smooth. The smaller screen lets you get away with turning down some higher end graphics options and still feel like you""re not sacrificing a huge amount. So, definitely happy that I can feel like I can take this super portable laptop with me as my primary machine and still do some gaming. Battery life is solid. I was able to get about 8 hours of video with the performance set at the Better batery setting. Using Battery saver and reducing the screen brightness a tad would most likely grab a couple more hours of playtime. The battery recharges quite fast to 80% battery saver setting to help keep your battery in better shape for longer. The power brick is really small, which is nice!One thing I love about this 360 is the fingerprint reader. It""s in a key space on the keyboard just to the right of the spacebar and alt key, and it""s so convenient! Unlocking the laptop is so easy when coming back to the computer. No more typing in passcodes every time! A couple other things I really love are the keys for muting the microphone and disabling the camera.

6496,6496,1549,"HP - ENVY x360 2-in-1 13.3"" Touchscreen Laptop - Intel Evo Platform - Intel Core i7 - 8GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Pale Gold",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/13m_bd0023dx,DisableAction,Person,Universal,CameraButton,"I thought it might be useful to compare this HP to another similar 2-in-1 that people may also be considering, the Lenovo Yoga 6.  I purchased both laptops on sale and paid $674.99 for the HP ENVY x360 2-in-1 as an open box in excellent condition, and $539.99 for the Lenovo Yoga 6.  Both come with current-gen processors and integrated graphics, and both come with 8GB RAM.  The HP does have a larger SSD, though at 512GB vs 256 for the Yoga 6.The HP x360 is quite a nice little laptop.  Compared to the Yoga 6, it^s a little thinner, a little lighter and has an overall slightly smaller footprint. It^s made of metal, its screen is brighter, its audio is better (despite downward-firing speakers), and I like that its keyboard has media controls and buttons to kill the webcam and mike. I also like that it has a micro-USB slot, and Thunderbolt 4.  The Yoga six has none of these things.But ultimately, I returned the HP in favor of the Lenovo Yoga 6.  The main reason was performance.While the HP x360 uses a 4-core, 8-thread 11th-gen Intel i7 w/the new Xe integrated graphics, the Yoga 6 uses the excellent AMD Ryzen 4650U Pro, a 6-core, 12-thread processor that is simply faster than Intel^s offering overall.  And while Intel has been touting their new Xe graphics as going head-to-head with the NVidia MX350, the truth is that in real-world applications, and at lower TDPs than Intel^s 28W reference laptop design, that^s just not true in my testing. Perhaps in time better drivers from Intel will close the gap, but it^s certainly not the case now. In fact, in actual use, the Xe graphics couldn^t even keep up with the Radeon Vega 6 graphics in the Yoga 6.  I ran a few benchmarks on these and will show just a couple of results here (see photos).In the photo of the two laptops side by side, you can see the results of a graphics benchmark test using the game Dirt Rally on battery power (since I like to game on the go with small laptops like these, I test on battery as well as plugged in.  Settings were identical for each ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 1600x900, medium preset, identical options, both laptops set to their performance modes, etc.  You can see that the Yoga 6 had an avg of 67.42 FPS with its Radeon Vega 6 graphics, vs 43.88 for the HP x360 with its intel Xe graphics (a 35% difference).  Min and max frames were also much higher with the Yoga 6, and you can see from the test summary that over the course of the benchmarking, the HP Envy dropped thousands of frames compared to the Yoga 6.  Every gaming benchmark I tested showed the Yoga 6 to consistently beat the HP ENVY x360 in frame rates.The other two photos show results from Novabench on battery.  Novabench is a quick and light benchmarking program, and I use it only to get a performance snapshot before doing more in-depth testing.  While the HP Envy scored 2057 overall, the Yoga 6 scored 2405 overall, and had higher sub scores for CPU, and Disk.  Interestingly, although the Envy did score slightly higher on the GPU and RAM sub scores, this did *not* translate into a real-world performance issue in use.  The Yoga 6 was just a little bit faster in daily use, and significantly faster in games.  It was also significantly faster to boot up ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 6 seconds compared to about 12 seconds.Again, the HP ENVY is a nice little laptop, and some people will have no issue paying more for the slightly smaller metal build, thunderbolt, brighter screen, etc. I don^t think it^s unreasonably priced (especially at the sale price) at all and would recommend it for those who understand what it can do, and what it can""t.  For my needs, however, I ultimately chose the Yoga 6.Finally, I thought I might try to answer a couple questions I saw that were asked and answered incorrectly here in Best Buy^s Questions.

It is a solid computer for both work and personal use, great specs and benchmarks, compact and light-weight, and looks and feels premium. Unfortunately, the battery life was horrible. That could""ve been due to the very bright display, but honestly I don""t need that bright a display for what I do (and if I do need it, I simply hook it up to an external monitor). Moreover, the display is great only at a very narrow range of angles. At maximum brightness, browsing the web over wifi caused the battery to run out in ~5.5 hours. For context, the laptop I am replacing is a 2015 HP Pavilion 13 inch 2-in-1, with i5-6th generation, and after five years it""s battery still lasted ~4.5 hours under an identical test (I did upgrade that to SSD storage though which helps). I did the same test a couple of times, varying only the brightness with the privacy screen turned on, and the maximum I got was 7 hours. With light PDF and spreadsheet work while connected to the internet at 50% brightness with the privacy screen, the battery died in less than 5 hours. I don""t know how they can claim up to 11 hour 45 min of mixed use! Unfortunately, not getting even close to the advertised battery life was a dealbreaker, and the improvement in battery over my Pavilion were only marginal, so I ended up returning it.I also purchased Lenovo Yoga 7i 14, and it is working great! In the light bechmarking I performed (and I am not an expert), the numbers were at worse only marginally lower and at best higher for Yoga with i5-11th gen tiger lake and 12 gb ram compared to Envy""s i7-11th gen tiger lake and 8 gb ram, with no real world difference in performance between the two. Envy does beat Yoga in terms of weight, size, and appearance, but not by much, and I can live with the differences. That plus the cost being $100 less with the current promotion and much longer battery life (easily 7+ hours) made me choose the Yoga 7i.",3,negative,"The person doesn""t like the battery life of this laptop.","Unfortunately, the battery life was horrible.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/f65bca8cf4eba5dc126649f93b89319a,2021-02-23T19:06:42,"Unfortunately, the battery life was horrible.",ChargeAction,Action Exist

However, it might be the best one you can buy at this price point. This wonderful HP laptop isn""t going to replace my Dell XPS 2-in-1, but this HP is about 33% less expensive than the Dell. For anybody in the market for a sub-$1000 unit, this is a solid choice. This laptop features a snappy solid state drive that allows the OS to boot up quickly and applications and other OS tasks to respond almost instantly. The keyboard is very nice and quite comfortable to type on and the trackpad doesn""t seem to get in the way while you type as often as some other laptops I""ve used. I found the quality of the webcam to be sufficient (still not as good as it could be) and it responded well to Zoom""s virtual backgrounds (my Dell struggles with this, so I can""t use it). The touchscreen works as expected and I was happy to learn that my wife""s Surface Pro stylus works on this screen, which might be a good option for somebody wanting to add a stylus. Of course, HP also has options available and I""m sure there are others. The screen is bright and vibrant (it""s 1000 nits), but the privacy filter on the screen does take some getting used to; you have to view this screen pretty much straight on. This is a solid feature for anybody concerned with shoulder surfing or general privacy. I also like that there are dedicated camera (shutter) and microphone buttons with visual indicators to turn off these features for added privacy. The fingerprint reader works very well; probably the best one I""ve seen in a Windows laptop. I really like how this laptop still includes USB-A ports (which are superspeed ports). All of the thin laptops I""ve seen over the last few years have not included these ports and I""ve always assumed it was because they simply didn""t have the vertical real-estate to include the relatively ""tall"" port. HP solved this problem by adding a spring-loaded, hinged cover. This gives you the ability to still connect a USB-A device without adding unnecessary thickness to the slim design. One USB-C port is also included. So why only four stars? I wanted to give this laptop five stars, but there were a couple of annoyances that I found that caused me to take off a few points. Given that they have included USB-C as an interfacing option, I would have liked to see a port on each side of the laptop and they use that as the charging port. USB-C has gained a lot of traction and popularity in the last couple of years and many manufacturers are choosing to use this as the new standard for charging/power-delivery. The specs list that the port has USB power delivery, but I have admittedly not tried to charge it via USB-C. Either way, they""ve included a round-plug style charger and port as the intended charging method. Next, while I really like that there are dedicated buttons to toggle the microphone and webcam on/off, for some reason they didn""t put them next to each other. In many cases, if you are toggling one of these features, you are probably toggling the other. It would have made more sense to me to have them proximally located next to each other, in my opinion. Also, while I think it""s cool that Alexa is built-in, she responds very slowly; maybe I""m just impatient, but I don""t think I should have to wait almost 5 seconds between saying ""Alexa"" and my intended request.

Following are what I found to be the pros and cons:Pros:- Between the Intel Core i7 Processor and the 512 GB Solid State Drive, this laptop is smokin"" fast! Much faster processing and storing files than my work PC""s or previous personal laptops. The improved speed is quite noticeable!- The picture quality, brightness and color are awesome! It really shows when watching a movie. Plus it has glass that goes from edge-to-edge, so it provides a nice size picture for a small laptop.- The battery is long-lasting. I have been working remotely so have used the laptop to access my company network. I have been able to work for an entire day without charging the battery. It would probably go quicker if gaming or watching a lot of videos, but it also charges back up quickly.- This is the first laptop I have had with a touch screen. I have found this to be a real nice and convenient feature. It also works with a stylus pen.- The 360 degree hinge is pretty cool, I can use it like a laptop while working and then convert it into a tablet to kick back and use it while lounging or watching a movie, as well as stand it up in different configurations. I haven""t had this before and it makes it ultra convenient to use in any position you want to sit!- This laptop is light weight, but it has a very solid feel to it. The unit, the hinges for the 360 degree rotation, the keyboard and everything about it just feel very well-made to me. I had looked at some other brands and some of them felt pretty cheap, like the hinges and such might break after some use. This one seems better made than other brands I looked at in the same price range.- It has some nice privacy features. I really like the camera privacy key that engages what they call an un-hackable camera shutter. I""ve always been a little worried about someone hacking me and accessing my camera or accidentally joining a work WebEx and having my camera on when I didn""t know it was on. This button makes it easy to ensure the camera is not on when you don""t want it on. It also has a microphone mute button for audio protection too. Finally, it has a 3D Fingerprint button for secure access, which is a nice feature and easier than keying in a PIN or password all the time.- The laptop was easy to set up. Wifi and Bluetooth connections were quite easy. The Cortana voice-assistant walks you through the complete set-up of the PC when you first turn it on.- For a small laptop, I think the sound is pretty good. It has Bang & Olufsen Speakers, which is a high end brand I haven""t seen in other laptops. The speakers are small of course, in order to fit, so you aren""t going to get a booming bass or anything like you would get if you connect a separate set of larger speakers, but the sound is better than my previous larger laptops had with their built-in speakers.- The backlit keyboard is nice, especially when I am using it while lounging in a dark room.- It comes with one USB-C port, two USB ports (one on each side), a micro-SD memory card reader and a combo headphone/microphone jack. I use the Bluetooth for my headphones though. So it seems to have all the necessary ports and connections covered.- I don""t use Amazon Alexa, but it does come with Alexa built in for those who use that.- I really like the pale gold color too. It is very pale, so almost looks silver. I have always had black laptops in the past, but this color has a classy, rich look to it.Cons:I honestly don""t have much in the way of cons, other than these two observations.- It does not come with a stylus pen or have a stylus doc. The screen works with a stylus pen, so it would have been nice if it had come with one or even if it had a doc to store a stylus. Some laptops come with the stylus and a doc in which the stylus is stored. Without the doc, I think it could be easy to lose track of a stylus.- This is the first 13.3"" laptop I have owned, I have previously had 17"" and 15"" laptops, so this is the first one I have had without a numeric keypad. I knew this when I got it and with a 13.3"" laptop, the keyboard really isn""t big enough to have a numeric keyboard. I do kind of miss having it at times, but it was well-worth the trade-off because I like the smaller sized laptop for convenience and using in tablet mode, etc.All-in-all, I think this is a great laptop and better than others I saw at this price-point!

It also works with a stylus pen.- The 360 degree hinge is pretty cool, I can use it like a laptop while working and then convert it into a tablet to kick back and use it while lounging or watching a movie, as well as stand it up in different configurations. I haven""t had this before and it makes it ultra convenient to use in any position you want to sit!- This laptop is light weight, but it has a very solid feel to it. The unit, the hinges for the 360 degree rotation, the keyboard and everything about it just feel very well-made to me. I had looked at some other brands and some of them felt pretty cheap, like the hinges and such might break after some use. This one seems better made than other brands I looked at in the same price range.- It has some nice privacy features. I really like the camera privacy key that engages what they call an un-hackable camera shutter. I""ve always been a little worried about someone hacking me and accessing my camera or accidentally joining a work WebEx and having my camera on when I didn""t know it was on. This button makes it easy to ensure the camera is not on when you don""t want it on. It also has a microphone mute button for audio protection too. Finally, it has a 3D Fingerprint button for secure access, which is a nice feature and easier than keying in a PIN or password all the time.- The laptop was easy to set up. Wifi and Bluetooth connections were quite easy. The Cortana voice-assistant walks you through the complete set-up of the PC when you first turn it on.- For a small laptop, I think the sound is pretty good. It has Bang & Olufsen Speakers, which is a high end brand I haven""t seen in other laptops. The speakers are small of course, in order to fit, so you aren""t going to get a booming bass or anything like you would get if you connect a separate set of larger speakers, but the sound is better than my previous larger laptops had with their built-in speakers.- The backlit keyboard is nice, especially when I am using it while lounging in a dark room.- It comes with one USB-C port, two USB ports (one on each side), a micro-SD memory card reader and a combo headphone/microphone jack. I use the Bluetooth for my headphones though. So it seems to have all the necessary ports and connections covered.- I don""t use Amazon Alexa, but it does come with Alexa built in for those who use that.- I really like the pale gold color too. It is very pale, so almost looks silver. I have always had black laptops in the past, but this color has a classy, rich look to it.Cons:I honestly don""t have much in the way of cons, other than these two observations.- It does not come with a stylus pen or have a stylus doc. The screen works with a stylus pen, so it would have been nice if it had come with one or even if it had a doc to store a stylus. Some laptops come with the stylus and a doc in which the stylus is stored. Without the doc, I think it could be easy to lose track of a stylus.- This is the first 13.3"" laptop I have owned, I have previously had 17"" and 15"" laptops, so this is the first one I have had without a numeric keypad. I knew this when I got it and with a 13.3"" laptop, the keyboard really isn""t big enough to have a numeric keyboard. I do kind of miss having it at times, but it was well-worth the trade-off because I like the smaller sized laptop for convenience and using in tablet mode, etc.All-in-all, I think this is a great laptop and better than others I saw at this price-point!

If you are a student or young professional who needs a laptop for everyday productivity and some fun, this is a great laptop for the price. NOTE: I purchased this for 750 dollars on sale, and such the 5 stars is for that price point. At the standard 1000 dollars I would give it a 4.25 stars and you might want also to look at other options.Performance: - A great integrated graphics card. The Xe Iris graphics allows you to play a lot of lighter weight games without much hiccups. I personally am able to play Civ 6 and League of Legends with great framerates and graphics. - Good size hard drive. The hard drive is big enough to hold on to a fair amount of movies, shows, games, etc. 512 GB is more than enough to not need a dedicated external HD to lug around.- 8 GB of RAM is okay for daily needs. I hear it can be upgraded so that helps in future proofing. Don""t expect to run a dozen programs at the same time on this.User Interface- The keyboard is mildly left shifted and not exactly centered. This will take some getting used to. - The trackpad is great, very responsive and feels great. - The screen is a great highlight! As someone who is concerned with security, the built in privacy screen is very welcome! The brightness is also amazing, I can go outside and still see everything very well. - The sound is very good. Not much bass, but very passable. Note that the speakers seems to be downward facing meaning that depending on the surface, or lack thereof, this laptop is on, the soundstage will seem different.IO- 2 USB A ports is a nice addition.- 1 USB C port is sufficient considering there is also a separate charging port. You will need to live the dongle life to use external monitors. - Micro SD card is amazing, lets me expand memory without external HD and allows me to download my camera/drone pictures without wires. - Headphone/mic jack is good.Overall, this is a good all around  mid-ranged laptop. For about half the price of similarly spec""d high end competitors, you can get the same performance. Do not expect a performance beast in this machine, buy a desktop or a bigger fatter laptop for that. On a scale of Mitsubishi Mirage to a BMW X8 this would be a highly spec""d out Toyota/Honda, dependable, highly usable, and luxurious enough for day to day use.",5,positive,The person likes to use the Memory SD card slot to upgrade memory.,"Micro SD card is amazing, lets me expand memory without external HD and allows me to download my camera/drone pictures without wires.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/2951583003ed9872d0976c6b5a6283d4,2021-02-28T19:26:58,#NAME?,UpgradeAction,Action Exist

The Yoga had this thing beat on paper in every way, but it had the worst keyboard on any laptop I""ve ever used, so I went with the HP here. I needed a 2-in-1 with multiple USB-A ports and a decent keyboard with USB-C charging and good battery life. I do not know if this supports USB-C charging 100% as I do not have other USB-C devices to charge as of yet, but others have reported it works fine and that their other USB-C chargers charge this laptop fine.My major issue with this device is the obscene amount of spyware and bloatware on this device. It is crazy how many things you find running in Task Manager and processes to kill in the Services snap in even AFTER deleting all the bloatware in Control Panel. Idle RAM usage is 4GB with all the crap the thing comes with. If you think you can reinstall Windows to rid the device of all of this, then think again, Using a USB flash drive to install Windows doesn""t work as the installer and DISKPART refuse to see the M.2 SSD, thus you have to reinstall Windows within Windows. You can install Linux on it just fine, but I""d advise leaving your Windows partition available as you""ll never be able to properly factory reset the device if you don""t have access to Windows.When you reinstall Windows with the ISO tool from Microsoft, the spyware (like the HP Trackpoint service) still ends up on the device after installation, even if you don""t connect to the internet during or after the install. I manually stopped the services in Services and set them to be disabled. With the spyware/bloatware rant over (you will need some technical knowledge to remove all of it), the battery life is OK. I""ve been getting about 6-7 hours with my mixed workload of using Chrome with YouTube running music/videos in the background while I write up documents or the like. The device""s fingerprint reader is iffy and I don""t love it. The screen gets super bright, but viewing angles are a little off for a device that can be used as a tablet. F.lux doesn""t agree with this display and causes issues like artifacting and flicker (not HP""s fault). The trackpad feels nice to me, although I have very small hands for a man (I typically fit the majority of women""s gloves). It definitely would be cramped for those with larger hands.

The Yoga had this thing beat on paper in every way, but it had the worst keyboard on any laptop I""ve ever used, so I went with the HP here. I needed a 2-in-1 with multiple USB-A ports and a decent keyboard with USB-C charging and good battery life. I do not know if this supports USB-C charging 100% as I do not have other USB-C devices to charge as of yet, but others have reported it works fine and that their other USB-C chargers charge this laptop fine.My major issue with this device is the obscene amount of spyware and bloatware on this device. It is crazy how many things you find running in Task Manager and processes to kill in the Services snap in even AFTER deleting all the bloatware in Control Panel. Idle RAM usage is 4GB with all the crap the thing comes with. If you think you can reinstall Windows to rid the device of all of this, then think again, Using a USB flash drive to install Windows doesn""t work as the installer and DISKPART refuse to see the M.2 SSD, thus you have to reinstall Windows within Windows. You can install Linux on it just fine, but I""d advise leaving your Windows partition available as you""ll never be able to properly factory reset the device if you don""t have access to Windows.When you reinstall Windows with the ISO tool from Microsoft, the spyware (like the HP Trackpoint service) still ends up on the device after installation, even if you don""t connect to the internet during or after the install. I manually stopped the services in Services and set them to be disabled. With the spyware/bloatware rant over (you will need some technical knowledge to remove all of it), the battery life is OK. I""ve been getting about 6-7 hours with my mixed workload of using Chrome with YouTube running music/videos in the background while I write up documents or the like. The device""s fingerprint reader is iffy and I don""t love it. The screen gets super bright, but viewing angles are a little off for a device that can be used as a tablet. F.lux doesn""t agree with this display and causes issues like artifacting and flicker (not HP""s fault). The trackpad feels nice to me, although I have very small hands for a man (I typically fit the majority of women""s gloves). It definitely would be cramped for those with larger hands.

The 2 in 1 design is a great feature and allows you to change things up by using it as a tablet.The display is fantastic. Colors are rich and vibrant. And even though it""s not 4k, the high gloss finish just really makes everything pop. The touch feature works great. It will recognize a light touch which is nice, and means that you don""t have to keep poking at it for it to recognize your touch. The touch pad is adequate. It has a nice feel and is very responsive. I""ve never used a touch pad that left me really impressed, and this one is not much different but, I have no specific complaint about it, it tracks well and has a textured finish that feels good.These days, 8GB of RAM is on the edge of good, and for the majority of people out there, it certainly is. With the solid state drive and the core i7 processor, this machine flies. I won""t be using it for games, so I can""t comment on the performance of them, but for everything I""ve used it for, speed was never even a thought. The backlit keyboard is really nice and very welcome. Every machine should just come with that feature. The large keys are easy to find and have a nice smooth action to them. The whole machine has a really good feel. As a bonus, it also includes a fingerprint reader.Ports are a bit scarce though. A Thunderbolt port, a couple of USB-A ports and a headphone port. It also has an SD card slot. That""s about it though. All in all, a really nice machine. Lightweight and very sleek is how I would describe it.

With the Intel i7 processor, this unit should be capable of meeting the average consumer everyday needs. This is as portable as a laptop can get. With a 13.3"" screen, it offers a decent size screen that is large enough to stream movies and videos while keeping the unit very slim and light weight. It is a sharp looking laptop. The display is crisp. Although it is not a 4k display, for the size of this laptop the 1080 display is sufficient and providing high quality video output. I will say that the display is very glossy and does get some bad reflections depending on angles and background lighting. Not sure if there is a antiglare cover that is compatible with this unit, but that may be helpful for the bright days.I must also note that the camera unlike some of HP""s other laptop models do not offer a manual cover. I believe there is a way to turn it off, however you don""t get that extra comfort level that your camera is not on. Lets"" not forget that this is a touch screen as well, which is a nice feature for additional functionality as the screen can flip back completely to lay on the bottom of the keyboard making this into a tablet.The speakers are from Bank and Olufsen, which offers pretty decent sound. It was a bit odd at first as the speakers are underneath the right and left sides of keyboard. I thought the sound would get a big muffled, but after streaming a show, it did do a decent job with the audio output.Battery seems great. I was able to get a 1/3rd of a charge in a half an hour while streaming at the same time.This unit boots up like a snap. I do like the finger print security option. It does a good job at recognizing multiple finger prints from multiple family members and unlocking quickly. If there is one gripe I have with this laptop, it would be the advertised ""Alexa enabled"" feature. Out of the box and after enabling, I had a very hard time to get it to function.

The fact that the screen can rotate 360 degrees is a plus but I dont see myself using that option much as I use an iPad Pro for tablet usage.

Colors are rich, full brightness is just as beautiful as my 4K TV side by side. They also put a privacy screen on the gorilla glass which effects the angle in which your watch from so if you are at your local coffee shop people will have a hard time seeing what is on your screen unless they are at the same viewing angle, really nice right! Battery life just as every device depends on how high the brightness is, I got 7hrs full brightness and stunning movie watching, color is just beautiful and rich. Best part, well, 2nd to the picture is the 360 hinged monitor! The hinges are nice and tight which allows you to watch in virtually any position and the keyboard goes to sleep once you turn it into a tablet and then the keyboard is on screen. I seen that HP has a battery powered pen available but i just use a regular Walmart stylus pen but if you do alot of drawing maybe you should invest in the powered stylus for more precision. You can also touch the screen at the same time as your stylus to use zoom feature and more.

I had to hold down the power button to shut it off.  When I turned it back on it was back to normal.  Not sure if it was a software thing because there were still a few updates I needed to finish, or if it was a hardware issue because when I picked up the SB3 from the store after they ordered it, the side of the box was crushed like something heavy fell on top of it during transportation.  (Side note: kind of disappointed that the Best Buy employee didn""t say anything about the damaged box or inform me of my options if the SB3 turned out to be damaged during transportation)  Hoping it was just a one-time glitch because I""ve been using it everyday for the past two weeks and it hasn""t happened again.",4,positive,The Student likes to detach the Surface Book 3 and use it as a tablet to take notes in class.,Very helpful for taking notes in college.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/e70d9252c77aee7d2330a728525391c2,2021-01-25T15:20:08,Very helpful for taking notes in college.,WriteAction,Action Exist

For the gamer in our home, high speed and picture quality take the experience to the right level. Both the keyboard and the screen/tablet became hot while gaming. For the art enthusiast in our home, having front and rear facing cameras as well as Paint 3D and 3D viewer to assist in photo editing, the touch screen surface with pen option makes this a nice tool to get creative with. I like the quality of the pictures I took of myself. They seem to be in matte format and are rather flattering. Playing videos and listening to music were of good quality. For my budding architect, we downloaded Autocad LT and let the building take off. The processing speed seems to be quite reactive to the time the screen gets touched. We didn^t experience any lag, at least none we could notice which to us translates into no lag. The surface comes with two batteries, one in the keyboard and one in the tablet/screen. Naturally something needs to continue to power the tablet once its been ejected. Yes, there^s an eject button on the keyboard so you may want to make those button happy aware that once that button is pressed it will release the tablet/screen from the keyboard and will be loose and needs to be removed or snapped back on. The keyboard lights up which is a fav feature of mine in any computer. I tend to burn the midnight oil but don^t like to work with overhead lights, so being able to see my keyboard is important. The keyboard has 3 levels of light intensity. The screen also can be brightened easily with tapping the screen. Like I said, the surface is very reactive. Almost like it knows what I plan to do before I do it. The computer stays cool during normal use but under gaming conditions gets hot. The battery seemed to last quite a bit when using software other than gaming and/or surfing the internet.The charger has a slim rectangular magnetic feature which attaches and detached easily from its port.

Pulling the Surface Book 3 out of the box it seems heavy for its size. They must have a lot crammed into a small package as it certainly has the specs. It looks sharp and feels premium and it should at this price point. As I went through the box looking to see what all came in the package I was upset to find there was no stylus included. At this price it should be included. Looking at the screen I noticed a sizable bezel. At first, I wondered why the bezel was so large before I realized it was probably for the attachment points between the keyboard and tablet.Turning it on there is a short boot time thanks to the SSD. There is the standard Windows 10 setup, which goes quick with some assistance from Cortana. The mouse pad is standard, and the keyboard has a selector to light up the keys, which comes in handy. The screen is sturdily attached to the keyboard and only comes apart when you press the detach button on the keyboard. Reattaching is as simple as putting the screen back in its place as it locks itself together. I really like that there are no vents on the bottom of the keyboard. The vent is well placed on the top of the keyboard and it^s not very noticeable. I love that I can set the Surface Book on my lap and not worry about blocking a vent and causing it to overheat. There is also a vent that goes around the entire screen and the speakers are hidden on the left and right sides. It^s also quiet and I haven^t heard a cooling fan yet. Listening to music and watching some videos I was pleasantly surprised with the sound system. It^s not audiophile quality but for movies and music it^s unexpected and surprisingly good. The Dolby Atmos creates an exceptional sound stage. The charger attaches magnetically and is an improvement over a coaxial power connection you see on most laptops. There are two USB connections, a single USB type C connection, headphone jack, and an SD card reader. Missing is an HDMI connection, which would be nice to have.I installed several programs, and each was quick to install and quick to open once installed. The SSD is nice and fast but it doesn^t appear to be interchangeable so make sure you get a model with enough storage space for your needs unless you plan to use external storage. Programs are also very responsive thanks to the i7 processor and 16 GB of memory. The touch screen is accurate and works well and the screen is sharp and produces good viewing angles. There are cameras on the front and back, but I mainly just use the front facing camera to identify my face to aid with the login.I^m currently in the midst of a project for work to create a manual and I^m using Acrobat DC. I^m using a lot of pictures in the manual that I^ve taken with my DSLR. To help organize and prepare everything I also have Lightroom and Photoshop. I^ve been running all three programs at the same time and this thing hasn^t skipped a beat. I^m able to quickly import RAW image files into Lightroom since the Surface Book has an SD card reader. I currently have 90 images imported and I can easily browse all the photos I^ve taken for the project at one time and switch between the RAW images without any lag. I can quickly make the necessary lens corrections and white balance adjustments before exporting to Photoshop for finetuning the image and saving it to a reduced size for the manual. I can then import the images into Acrobat. The speed at which I^m able to go from one program to another is great and it really makes the project so much easier to complete. With 93 imported RAW images in Lightroom, 18 photos open for editing in Photoshop, and Acrobat DC open for editing a 110-page manual all at the same time there are no issues with performance and I have absolutely zero complaints over the performance of this machine.One thing to note is that the Surface Book has two batteries. One in the tablet and one in the keyboard. Together they give you pretty good battery life but separate them and the smaller battery in the tablet will only give you around 3 hours of use.Overall, I^m happy with the Surface Book 3. It^s more than capable to handle anything I can throw at it. I think a stylus and an HDMI port would have been nice additions. Better battery life for the tablet portion of the Surface Book would also be welcome. Otherwise it^s an excellent machine, although expensive, and I know I will get plenty of use out of it.",5,positive,The Person likes the Sound System of the Surface Book 3 to watch movies.,watching some videos I was pleasantly surprised with the sound system,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/7e9b1de34986c25dc98a4562932e89cc,2021-01-25T20:24:02,Listening to music and watching some videos I was pleasantly surprised with the sound system.,WatchAction,Action Exist

Having owned and used mobile computers from many of the top manufacturers, I can definitely say that for me, this package is among the nicest looking available. Gorgeous design. All the way from the mirrored Windows logo, to the sleek shape, and the perfectly machined aluminum housing. While you may instantly think this is a very similar design to the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂother guysÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ I can say without a doubt that the Surface Book 3 is one awesome looking piece of tech that should satisfy anyone wanting a mobile computer solution. The feel is also very modern and high tech. The build quality also feels solid. It^s not a light computer weighing in at just over four pounds, but that doesn^t bother me at all. In fact I prefer the weight of it which only adds to its premium look and overall feel.SETUP & UPDATINGOnce unboxed and charged, and after Cortana got me connected to WiFi, I proceeded directly into setup and Windows updates, which I highly recommend being your first step regardless of what type of tech you have purchased. With my home WiFi connection, initial setup and Windows updates took roughly 15-20 minutes to complete. After updating through Windows update, I also recommend opening the Microsoft Store App and updating all available Apps that you choose to keep on your system. All of the aforementioned updates will ensure that everything on your computer is running a peak performance. This entire process is extremely easy and should be a breeze for any level of user to complete. Once all updates are complete, customization can begin! Start loading the software you use and customize the look of your computer to fit you personally.SCREEN / TEXTThe screen! Finally! I have always complained that Windows computers never had sharp text, but I can now safely say that this screen (at full resolution) provides the sharp text I want to see when reading articles, or simply browsing websites, looking through File Explorer, etc. Text is definitely cleaned up, sharp, and nice. Netflix and streaming sites look really great in HD, with gorgeous colors popping off the screen. PAD MODEThis may be the Surface Books coolest feature. The Surface Book 3 is literally a Tablet and a Computer Laptop in one awesome package. It^s up to you to decide how you want to use it. There is a dedicated ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂejectÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ button that seems to electronically eject the screen for tablet use, instead of a physical eject button. By this I mean that when the button is pressed, the computer unlocks the screen and lets you know when it is safe to detach. Once detached, you can either use it with a Surface Pen (more on this later), or your fingers. A virtual keyboard is also included in this mode. Also worth mentioning, is that if you edit photos in Photoshop, you must eject the screen, then place it back on backwards and fold it down over the keyboard. The reason being is that your photos are stored on your local HD, not in your screen! Photo editing is awesome on this computer in pad mode (more on this later).KEYBOARDThe keyboard is soft touch, feels solid, and is very quiet. The backlighting includes three levels of brightness. One thing to point out, is that when you stop typing, it takes about 20 seconds before the backlighting fades out to save battery. Once you start typing again, the backlighting turns back on immediately. A nice touch.SD CARD READERThe inclusion of an SD card reader is ALWAYS welcome to me. As a full time photographer, I can definitely appreciate having this as standard on the Surface Book 3.USBThis computer provides you with two USB 3.1 and one USB C port, making connecting today""s peripherals a snap. If you need more, you can always grab the Surface Dock, or a USB Hub. OSWindows 10 Home is included and is working great for me. Updating to Windows 10 Pro is something I may do soon for the extra security features alone. Windows 10 has gotten its fair share of criticism for updates failing certain users. That said, I have not run into any issues and everything is working flawlessly at this time. The Windows 10 user experience is sleek and easy to navigate. I find that coming from a different OS to Windows 10 is not only easy to adapt to, but also a much needed breath of fresh air. It is much more customizable. Go to a Best Buy store and take it for a spin. I bet you^ll be glad you did. APPSI mainly use this computer for mobile editing and display of my photo and video work. I have the Adobe CC Suite installed and have found that this computer can handle any of the Adobe Apps with ease. That said, if you are editing 4K video in Premiere Pro, you will still want to create proxies to speed up your workflow, as is the case with even highly specced out systems. Once your proxies are created, you can scrub and edit with ease. The Adobe Apps all work wonderfully. They are responsive and look amazing on this screen. BATTERYThe battery life seems good to me, but could always be better. It really depends on how you use the system, as to how much battery life you will get. Graphic intensive apps and games will deplete your battery much quicker than basic web browsing and office work. Keeping your brightness cranked at all times will also take some juice.ACCESSORIESI have purchased the Surface Pen to go with my computer and couldn^t be happier with this combo. The pen is a must with this screen and enables you to go in close when editing photos, or using a drawing app. As a bonus, the pen has a pretty strong magnetic connection to the left screen side of the computer, so you^ll never have to set it on the desk to misplace or forget. The pen and Surface Book are in the same family, therefore they pair and work very well together.CONCLUSIONI can^t find very many negatives with this computer other than the battery life may not be enough for some users. I could also do with the power button being relocated, as almost every time I take the screen off and put it back on, I accidentally hit this button and turn off my screen. I^ll admit, I was playing on the other side of the fence for years when it comes to computing. Having said that, I feel refreshed with my Surface Book 3. It^s new, it^s fun, and it^s downright gorgeous.Reviewers in this invitation-only program are provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews.",5,positive,"The Employee likes the compatibility of applications with the Surface Book 3 to edit mobile, photos and videos.",I mainly use this computer for mobile editing and display of my photo and video work,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/5058c06c3d8f05a3454e7c23ed06d6be,2021-01-25T22:15:24,APPSI mainly use this computer for mobile editing and display of my photo and video work.,EditAction,Action Exist

I had never owned a Surface before, and I have to say, I was SUPER excited. I had seen them being used on the NFL games on the sidelines, and I had always heard about their great performance in a small package. The Surface Book 3 is 30% faster than the Surface Book 2, so quite a difference in an upgrade.Right away, like any other laptop, I installed the entire Microsoft 365 product suite, Adobe Creative suite (Photoshop/Indesign/Illustrator/Dreamweaver/Muse/XD/etc. and it performs fantastically. I even bought a stylus to go with the Microsoft Surface, for additional greatness. The touchpoints are spot on, and so many settings for drawing. The sensitivity is like I am actually drawing with pen/ink/watercolor. The ability to use this as a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂportable studioÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ is great. Definition AlertÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂStylus InputAn active stylus/pen is able to communicate directly with a compatible device; active electromagnetic resonance (EMR) pens are powered via a device""s screen and active electrostatic (AES) pens require an additional power source. A passive stylus does not have electronic features and is compatible with most capacitative touch screens.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂI share my designs and layouts with clients all the time, and this makes it easy to do so. When I put it in landscape mode, it is about the width of a letter size paper, but taller. I feel like the screen size is PERFECT for that. I debated between the 13ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ size, but I am glad I did the larger screen, because in laptop mode, the screen is bigger, and the keyboard and size is just more fitting for me, and then when I want to use the screen for drawing and presenting, it is large enough that I don^t have to zoom in on things for my clients to see. It helps that the resolution (3240x2160) is crystal clear too. CONNECTIONS:There are volume buttons and the power button on the top of the monitor, so that it can be used when undocked from the keyboard. The whole unit folds down closed, but there is about a 4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ beveled section where you can put your fingertip or thumb to lift open and separate them. That was a very good design, because I have a 2-in-1 Dell XPS that does not have that and it is super hard to open up. This however, is great. There are 2 USB 3.0 ports that you can plug things into, but also a USB-C type input where I connect an external USBÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂC port hub, to add additional monitors (HDMI) when I work at home. The keyboard/tablet opens up to about a 135 degree angle so it will not fold over flat. I don^t think that is a negative, because you are not going to carry around your keyboard if you are using it while you are mobile anyway. To disconnect, you press the disconnect button, and it unlocks the tablet from the keyboard. There is also a way to undock if you click on the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂsurface detach ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Action RequiredÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in the task bar. I was a little confused about that, because I thought I had to do something like an update, but it actually just undocks the tablet. Once it is ready, a green notification banner says, it is ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂReady to Detach.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ There is an SD Card reader, rear facing camera and front facing camera. There is also a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂWindows HelloÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ camera for when I want to sign in, and not even type in a password. It recognizes my face, and it unlocks the device using the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂFacial RecognitionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ camera integrated with Windows 10. The power cable is magnetic, so no need to worry about that awkward plug that gets kicked, and bends the laptop plug or wrecks the plugin. This would just disconnect (magnetic) and no harm done, other than your clumsy friend/family member that just tripped over a cord for whatever reason. It is reversable too, so depending on how you are holding the tablet or laptop mode, or where you have the plug facing. I really like that. RESOLUTION:WowÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦.it is so crisp and clear, I was amazed. The color is fantastic while Photoshop editing, as my monitors have always been an issue for me in the past. I always had to calibrate the monitors, and different brands were different colors, so it was a pain, but not anymore. I watched Netflix on this, using the Windows 10 app, and it was spectacular, compared to my other laptops. BATTERY LIFE:Uhhh so yeah, the battery lasts and lasts, compared to ALL my other laptops. I left it on to download a bunch of programs, and upload my files, and shut off the rules for sleep/shut down after a preset duration, because I wanted it to complete. I came back the next morning, and it was still on and going strong. The stats say a 17.5 hour battery life, and based on my overnight experience it could be 100% true. With a 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ screen that is really, really good.SOUND:The sound quality is really pretty good too, considering I cannot see an actual speaker. There is a headphone jack on the side of the tablet, and I thought the sound was coming from there. Turns out there is a very thin area around the entire edge of the tablet that allows the sound to flow through it. There is no ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbassÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but then again, what laptop or tablet does? The sound is crisp and clear though, and not a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtinnyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ sound like all my other laptops sound like. If you want a full sound, Microsoft also has a headset for good full sound. Bluetooth connection allows you to connect practically anything, so if you already have a Bluetooth headset like I do, I can connect it that way for a FULL bass sound. The Surface has ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfar-field Studio Mics and DolbyÃÂÃÂ® AudioÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ soundÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ so when you want to be on a conference call, you can walk away from your laptop and draw on your whiteboard, and still be in crystal clear video AND the people can hear you well, without having to talk much louder.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂYOUR PHONEÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ:So Windows 10 has this connectivity app for your phone to connect to the Microsoft Surface, and it is actually called ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂYour Phone.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ I really, really, really like that app. In the past, I was using a 3rd party message web application/web thing before, but this is integrated right into the Windows 10, so I can see all the push notifications, sms text messages, photos, and even answer phone calls. You read that right, phone calls. No more sorry, my phone was on vibrate/silent and didn^t hear your call, or see your text message excuse. You can add/remove privacy connections with what you want to share/see on your laptop, so if you only want phone calls, you can do that. If you only want text messages to show, etc., you get the idea. There was a new update required for this to work with my phone, but it said it had to download the new update, and it worked perfectly after that. On my phone, it shows when I am connected to the laptop. So how do you text a photo you just took??? Well, it connects to your photos too, so you can see everything in your camera folder as well. I can type faster on the keyboard than I can on my phone, so this is quite slick.MY WISHES??:Honestly, I was very pleased and happy with my new Microsoft Surface Book 3. BuuuutÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦.If I had to suggest anything that I would change, I would say that I would prefer the larger SSD hard drive, for more storage space. They have other options with larger storage SSD^s, so it really isn^t an actual issue. Yes, there is Microsoft One Drive for storage, so it can backup all your work, but I am used to 1 TB of storage with all my client files and photoshop/video files that add up quickly. It all depends on what sort of thing you do, when using this Surface, and how much storage you use. I don^t even know if it is possible, but how cool would it be if there could be a number keypad on the section just to the right of the touchpad of the keyboard. Sure, it would be hard to type on the letters section, because you rest your wrists on that sectionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦but what if it had a sliding cover??? When you want to use the keypad or are entering info, you slide it open and away you go, then close when done.

The sensitivity is like I am actually drawing with pen/ink/watercolor. The ability to use this as a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂportable studioÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ is great. Definition AlertÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂStylus InputAn active stylus/pen is able to communicate directly with a compatible device; active electromagnetic resonance (EMR) pens are powered via a device""s screen and active electrostatic (AES) pens require an additional power source. A passive stylus does not have electronic features and is compatible with most capacitative touch screens.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂI share my designs and layouts with clients all the time, and this makes it easy to do so. When I put it in landscape mode, it is about the width of a letter size paper, but taller. I feel like the screen size is PERFECT for that. I debated between the 13ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ size, but I am glad I did the larger screen, because in laptop mode, the screen is bigger, and the keyboard and size is just more fitting for me, and then when I want to use the screen for drawing and presenting, it is large enough that I don^t have to zoom in on things for my clients to see. It helps that the resolution (3240x2160) is crystal clear too. CONNECTIONS:There are volume buttons and the power button on the top of the monitor, so that it can be used when undocked from the keyboard. The whole unit folds down closed, but there is about a 4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ beveled section where you can put your fingertip or thumb to lift open and separate them. That was a very good design, because I have a 2-in-1 Dell XPS that does not have that and it is super hard to open up. This however, is great. There are 2 USB 3.0 ports that you can plug things into, but also a USB-C type input where I connect an external USBÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂC port hub, to add additional monitors (HDMI) when I work at home. The keyboard/tablet opens up to about a 135 degree angle so it will not fold over flat. I don^t think that is a negative, because you are not going to carry around your keyboard if you are using it while you are mobile anyway. To disconnect, you press the disconnect button, and it unlocks the tablet from the keyboard. There is also a way to undock if you click on the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂsurface detach ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Action RequiredÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in the task bar. I was a little confused about that, because I thought I had to do something like an update, but it actually just undocks the tablet. Once it is ready, a green notification banner says, it is ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂReady to Detach.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ There is an SD Card reader, rear facing camera and front facing camera. There is also a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂWindows HelloÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ camera for when I want to sign in, and not even type in a password. It recognizes my face, and it unlocks the device using the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂFacial RecognitionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ camera integrated with Windows 10. The power cable is magnetic, so no need to worry about that awkward plug that gets kicked, and bends the laptop plug or wrecks the plugin. This would just disconnect (magnetic) and no harm done, other than your clumsy friend/family member that just tripped over a cord for whatever reason. It is reversable too, so depending on how you are holding the tablet or laptop mode, or where you have the plug facing. I really like that. RESOLUTION:WowÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦.it is so crisp and clear, I was amazed. The color is fantastic while Photoshop editing, as my monitors have always been an issue for me in the past. I always had to calibrate the monitors, and different brands were different colors, so it was a pain, but not anymore. I watched Netflix on this, using the Windows 10 app, and it was spectacular, compared to my other laptops. BATTERY LIFE:Uhhh so yeah, the battery lasts and lasts, compared to ALL my other laptops. I left it on to download a bunch of programs, and upload my files, and shut off the rules for sleep/shut down after a preset duration, because I wanted it to complete. I came back the next morning, and it was still on and going strong. The stats say a 17.5 hour battery life, and based on my overnight experience it could be 100% true. With a 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ screen that is really, really good.SOUND:The sound quality is really pretty good too, considering I cannot see an actual speaker. There is a headphone jack on the side of the tablet, and I thought the sound was coming from there. Turns out there is a very thin area around the entire edge of the tablet that allows the sound to flow through it. There is no ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbassÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ but then again, what laptop or tablet does? The sound is crisp and clear though, and not a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtinnyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ sound like all my other laptops sound like. If you want a full sound, Microsoft also has a headset for good full sound. Bluetooth connection allows you to connect practically anything, so if you already have a Bluetooth headset like I do, I can connect it that way for a FULL bass sound. The Surface has ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂfar-field Studio Mics and DolbyÃÂÃÂ® AudioÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ soundÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ so when you want to be on a conference call, you can walk away from your laptop and draw on your whiteboard, and still be in crystal clear video AND the people can hear you well, without having to talk much louder.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂYOUR PHONEÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ:So Windows 10 has this connectivity app for your phone to connect to the Microsoft Surface, and it is actually called ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂYour Phone.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ I really, really, really like that app. In the past, I was using a 3rd party message web application/web thing before, but this is integrated right into the Windows 10, so I can see all the push notifications, sms text messages, photos, and even answer phone calls. You read that right, phone calls. No more sorry, my phone was on vibrate/silent and didn^t hear your call, or see your text message excuse. You can add/remove privacy connections with what you want to share/see on your laptop, so if you only want phone calls, you can do that. If you only want text messages to show, etc., you get the idea. There was a new update required for this to work with my phone, but it said it had to download the new update, and it worked perfectly after that. On my phone, it shows when I am connected to the laptop. So how do you text a photo you just took??? Well, it connects to your photos too, so you can see everything in your camera folder as well. I can type faster on the keyboard than I can on my phone, so this is quite slick.MY WISHES??:Honestly, I was very pleased and happy with my new Microsoft Surface Book 3. BuuuutÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦.If I had to suggest anything that I would change, I would say that I would prefer the larger SSD hard drive, for more storage space. They have other options with larger storage SSD^s, so it really isn^t an actual issue. Yes, there is Microsoft One Drive for storage, so it can backup all your work, but I am used to 1 TB of storage with all my client files and photoshop/video files that add up quickly. It all depends on what sort of thing you do, when using this Surface, and how much storage you use. I don^t even know if it is possible, but how cool would it be if there could be a number keypad on the section just to the right of the touchpad of the keyboard. Sure, it would be hard to type on the letters section, because you rest your wrists on that sectionÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦but what if it had a sliding cover??? When you want to use the keypad or are entering info, you slide it open and away you go, then close when done. Ok, that is more of a pipe dream for any laptop, because you can get a Bluetooth number pad to connect.*Reviewers in this invitation-only program are provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews.CONCLUSION:A total yes! Oh, I was so excited, I didn^t ask the question yetÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¦.would I recommend this Microsoft Surface Book 3? ABSOLUTELY YES! It is expensive, compared to other standard laptops in the industry, but this is not JUST a laptop. It is so much more, and hopefully over this review, you would have already picked up on that part. This is great for the active designer, on-the-go/on-site person, you name it, it would be productive for you. If you are one who has 2 devices, 1 for a touch screen drawing device (maybe a Wacom) and a laptop as well, this is the perfect device for you! If you are a construction worker who walks around the job site or has to get signatures from clients who are building a new home, this is perfect for you. When we built our home, the Construction Manager had a Microsoft Surface as well, but it was the smaller size.

It^s still an elegant, durable and versatile design. And the hinge is still just an excellent piece of engineering. The quality and the materials and build are top notch as they have been since Microsoft introduced the Surface Book. And it doesn^t just pass the eye test. It still feels like a premium piece of equipment too.This model does come with the performance base that boasts a 1660ti graphics card that helps a lot when using graphic intensive programs such as Photoshop and/or AutoCAD. I was having some performance issues at first but realized that the program itself was using the integrated graphics rather than the dedicated GPU in the base. If for some reason you have issues like this, check your settings in the nvidia control panel to be sure whatever programs you are using are using the correct one. It may not default to the desired one on install. The auto-select option may not be what you need either.Microsoft has improved the sequence to detach the display over previous versions that also have the performance base. The button to release it has a nice and very subtle click when pressed. It gives you just enough feedback to know that you^ve started the process and the screen prompts will let you know when it^s ready to physically remove. That is unless you^re using a program that is currently using the dGPU. In which case you will need to close those programs first before detaching.Some might say that it defeats the purpose of being able to use the base and to utilize its mobility. Well, that wouldn^t be completely wrong. Although that is a little frustrating it^s not a deal breaker. The unit itself performed well when it was properly set up. It barely showed any sign of slowing down while touching up photos and having a few CAD projects open at the same time.This is really close to being the perfect desktop replacement for most. I absolutely recommend this product but suggest those who are thinking about making this purchase to get their hands on it in person to get a feel for it first.",4,positive,The Person likes the speed of the Surface Book 3 to edit photos.,It barely showed any sign of slowing down while touching up photos and having a few CAD projects open at the same time.,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/173500e286f3526066d37e6d9eafef3a,2021-01-28T09:04:51,It barely showed any sign of slowing down while touching up photos and having a few CAD projects open at the same time.This is really close to being the perfect desktop replacement for most.,EditAction,Action Exist

I have been using a Surface Pro 3 for years now, and while I love the portability and power it provided, it was needing something capable of a bit more heavy lifting. Especially since the current state of the world means I""ll be working from home even more frequently. I love taking notes on the Surface Pro 3, so I wanted to be able to continue to do so on a whatever new machine I upgraded to. That""s why the Surface Book 3 was so appealing to me. It combines the touchscreen and pen input capabilities with a very capable GTX 1660ti graphics card in the base. It""s the best of both worlds for me. In my day-to-day work requirements, I do lots of photo editing and design work in Photoshop, as well as motion graphics in After Effects, video editing in Premiere Pro and vector illustration in Illustrator. I also like to dabble in 3d modeling.When I was offered the chance to test a Surface Book 3 from the Tech Insider program, I jumped at the chance. Reviewers in this invitation-only program are provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews. Over the last few days, I""ve been putting this machine to through the ringer. It has absolutely handled all that I""ve thrown at it so far. I""m currently working on some motion graphics and web design assets for an upcoming conference. I had begun the motion graphics work on my current desktop machine and was curious how well the Surface Book would handle it. It has performed very well. I am getting render speeds similar (and in many cases, better) than my workstation PC (with a Xeon processor and a bit older Quadro graphics card). I imagine this is in part due to the newer processor the Surface Book is using. It""s very satisfying to be working on a project and disconnect the screen to take some notes from a meeting.Speaking of which, the screen removal is very interesting as well. Windows will tell you when there is software that will be impacted by removing the screen from the base (since you""ll be unable to use the discrete graphics card when removed). Very handy. There is a slight delay when you tap the button to remove it before you can actually remove the screen, but it""s only around a second or two.While testing with Photoshop, I was able to easily edit large files (the screenshot I""ve shown is me editing a 265mb file) without any performance issues whatsoever, including zooming/panning around the image and applying effects to smart objects and with many layers. Photoshop performs VERY well on this machine. Testing with the ever-demanding After Effects, performance was also very good. In the screenshot I""ve shown, I am in the middle of an intro video for the conference project I spoke about. I was deliberately trying to tax the machine by using multiple instances of some demanding effects and expressions (After Effects"" scripting language), since After Effects is very taxing to the CPU. Render times were equal to, or better than my desktop machine. All while running off battery! Very impressive. I also wanted to test the rendering speed of a complex scene in Blender. I downloaded one of the demo scenes that Blender makes available on their website, since it would be much more advanced than anything I""ve created. This one titled ""Spring"". It""s some beautiful work, and the final render took approximately one hour for a 1000x2000 image. Again, very impressive for a portable machine, all while working on battery power.Speaking of the battery- the battery life has been pretty great. Since I""ve been working the machine very hard, it""s battery life has been about 7 hours. Again, this is when I""m doing very demanding tasks, like creating or rendering in After Effects, or that Blender rendering. During less demanding use (web browsing, word processing, coding), I""m getting very good battery life, much better than I anticipated. I""d say around 12 hours. That""s sort of tough for me to estimate, since I""m not using it non-stop for those times. Also, a nice little side-effect of the processor being in the screen, rather than the base like most laptops, there is little to no heat on your lap. Even during demanding tasks, since most of the heat is generated at the screen/tablet area of the machine and quietly sent out from it. Another nice feature for video editing and motion graphics, is the aspect ratio of the screen. It""s a little taller than other laptops, which is actually very helpful. This gives you additional room for your audio/video tracks and feels less cramped that standard 16:9 displays. It also has excellent and accurate color reproduction.Overall, I""m extremely impressed with this machine. It is exactly what I was hoping it would be. If I had any complaints, it would be that this particular model I am testing is only a 256gb SSD. It""s fine for most things, but I just need to make sure and offload any large projects once I""m done. The bright side of that, is that it will make me better about backing up my projects. :) I also wouldn""t have minded getting one with a more RAM. The 16gb performs VERY well, but I imagine I could squeeze out even more performance with the 32gb model. If you""re looking for a machine that can perform any creative tasks, I""m not sure there""s a better form factor out there. The ability to use high end full-featured editing software, while also being able to use a pen input is absolutely great. Especially when you have the screen removed, or reversed to create a slightly elevated canvas.Pros: Beautiful looking machine, great productivity features, love the removable screen to use as a tablet along with the pen input, taller aspect ratio, excellent performance in Photoshop, After Effects, Blender and FreeCAD, excellent battery life, very color-accurate screen, pretty decent as a gaming machine too (I didn""t want to get too much into this, since I think most people are probably looking for productivity, but the GTX 1660ti is a pretty capable graphics card for gaming as well. I played some recent games, like Gears Tactics and it was performing very well in it)Cons: I would like to have a larger SSD, as the model I was offered is only 256gb, I wouldn^t mind the trackpad being a bit larger (though, I can""t completely say this is a con just yet, since my hands do rest nicely to the sides of it while typing, so I think I""ll just have to see after more prolonged use if I would really prefer it to be larger)",5,positive,The Person likes using programs of the Surface Book 3 to edit photos. ,"I do lots of photo editing and design work in Photoshop, as well as motion graphics in After Effects, video editing in Premiere Pro and vector illustration in Illustrator.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/8a83f6fc8b41274649ec3f2378fc1bca,2021-01-28T09:07:59,"In my day-to-day work requirements, I do lots of photo editing and design work in Photoshop, as well as motion graphics in After Effects, video editing in Premiere Pro and vector illustration in Illustrator.",EditAction,Action Exist

A bright 15 inch ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPixel SenseÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ detachable monitor with a resolution of 3240 x 2160 pixels rounds out the major features. Microsoft can configure this generation of Surface Book in a number of ways from a 13 to 15 inch monitor, i5 or i7 processors, or up to 32 gigs of RAM and more powerful graphics, so depending on your needs, there will be a variation of this you can configure that^s best for you (at a cost, of course).Full disclosure: Best Buy reviewers in this invitation-only program are provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews. I will always provide my honest opinions on all products reviewed. .One of the main reasons people get these are for the versatility. The screen (which houses some of the laptop^s guts) can be detached and used like a tablet on it^s own, with it^s own battery supply built in. When used with the Surface Pen (which unfortunately they do NOT include with these units), your creative juices can go wild with the bright, colorful, high-res screen. The backlit keyboard unit has a battery of it^s own as well, and when the two are attached, you get some pretty good battery life as well as much improved graphics power as this is where the graphic card is housed. A note though ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ a 17 hour possible battery life is quoted in specs, and in reality, I found it to be a bit less than half of that when running the screen at least at 50% brightness and doing ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂreal worldÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ projects and uses. Your mileage may vary depending on how you use it. You can use it as a standard laptop, or detach the screen and re-attach it backwards to use in tent mode or as a tablet with the keyboard attached, or just carry around the screen as a standalone tablet (with less power as the graphic card and one of the batteries are again, housed, in the keyboard section). One minor issue is that with the monitor holding several components inside, it can get a bit warm in use, but it never gets so hot that it^s worrisome. The keyboard and track pad feel rock solid, and the Surface 3 has a nice typing feel to it, and has the ports most need; two USB-3 ports, one USB-C, SD card reader, headphone jack. Speakers are standard in terms of volume and clarity ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ nothing outstanding but much better than on lesser machines. The web cam is very good being true HD, and has very good lower light clarity. A ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂrearÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ camera (in the upper corner of the lid) is also of good quality if you have need of it. The microphones are clear, though I did find I had to speak up just a bit louder than on some other machines for them to pick me up and react. A magnetic connector on the charger helps prevent accidents if someone or a pet walks by and accidentally pulls the power cord while in use ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it just pops free of the machine, preventing it from being dragged off of the table.Processing power overall is good. The Surface Book 3 breezed through Paint Shop Pro projects even with multiple layers being applied to photos, large resizing of pics, and having several projects open at once. I decided to try to tax the system by using an old Microsoft screen capture program called Expression Encoder ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it allows you to take screen captures of video up to 10 minutes in length (free version), and when converting and saving those clips to your computer, can really tax a system. My mid-range desktop will whine and whirrrr (fan) when using it, sounding like it^s near death. It can take several minutes to process even shorter 4-5 minute videos. The Surface Book handled this pretty well. I took some 3-5 minute grabs and encoded them to save, and while the fan did come on and it was still pushing some limits, overall it did a very good job handling this. The i7 processor and dedicated Nvidia graphics worked well together. The machine did get a little warm during the processing, but not ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂhotÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. I don^t think this will give people any issues when using it for video processing and conversions, especially if you configure it with a bit more RAM. 4K video playback went without any hiccups. I wouldn^t give it an award for processing power, but it^s about what I would expect from any laptop with this configuration of hardware. Because you are dealing with a thin laptop with cooling considerations that a desktop may not have, I think the processor operates at a lower wattage than it^s cousins used in desktops, because while again, the processing power is ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂgoodÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ, a very similarly configured desktop I use at work seemed to work a bit faster as it of course has cooling fans, and more room for air circulation. Not a problem for daily tasks, photo editing, basic video editing, etc. If you want to get more serious, you^ll want to configure a machine with more RAM and higher Graphics. If you will be using this quite a bit in tablet mode, consider the 13 inch option, as while the 15 inch model is great for desk and office work, it^s a bit bulky to use as a tablet ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the 13 inch version would be your option if you are in the field, traveling, or holding that screen a lot.Glitches? Only one so far. You can as with many Windows laptops now, configure your login so that the web cam recognizes your face and speeds up the login process. Twice, I^ve had it do this, yet the web cam will stay ON, along with the on light and red Windows Hello cam light next to it. Trying to go into the camera app to turn it off didn^t work and I^ve had to reboot to reset it correctly. It^s only happened twice but hopefully will be fixed in a firmware/software update at some point. The Surface Book 3 is not inexpensive. It^s a well spec machine with a bright, beautiful, removable screen, and is built very well, and you do pay for that, along with it^s various special features. In order to justify the price tag, you should be someone who will take advantage of those features. This would necessitate having the Surface Pen, and that^s one of my big gripes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ that they don^t include it. The approx. $100 pen is an additional feature, which in my opinion, should be included with EVERY Surface Book configuration. The retail price for my configuration hovers around the $2,300 range. You do get excellent build quality and a premium screen for that price, but in my opinion, I think for this price, the SSD drive should be at least 512 gigs (or even 1 TB?) and again, the Surface Pen should be included. I^ll be greedy, too ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ an outstanding extra would be a basic protective case you could slip the monitor in when in tablet-only mode to protect it and prop it up while in use (I can dream, can""t I?). Only you can decide if the price is justified for your specific needs and uses, but if it is, you should enjoy the investment. If not and you just need the basic specs, shop around as you can get something without quite all the bells and whistles for a few hundred less.",4,positive,The Person likes the processing power of the Surface Book 3 to edit photos.,"The Surface Book 3 breezed through Paint Shop Pro projects even with multiple layers being applied to photos, large resizing of pics, and having several projects open at once.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/c14dbfd1cac037cb6da4832aa5159ca5,2021-01-28T21:49:26,"The Surface Book 3 breezed through Paint Shop Pro projects even with multiple layers being applied to photos, large resizing of pics, and having several projects open at once.",EditAction,Action Exist

This laptop is a lightweight, versatile and a beautifully unique designed powerhouse.I have been using this laptop now for a little over a week now for multiple things such video editing, photoshop using Adobe photoshop, graphic designing, gaming, office work, everyday use such as writing this review and I must say it has excelled in every aspect, it has yet to let me down. The laptop and tablet in one is such an amazing design and done very successfully by Microsoft, in my perspective, that you have everything you need for whatever life demands all at your fingertips. If you need to get something done on the go just simply detach the tablet portion and get it done. The only downside to the tablet portion is that your dedicated graphic card and larger battery are built into the keyboard portion of the laptop to keep the tablet design slim, so you do end up losing a little bit of the graphics and battery in the tablet mode.The Surface Book 3 came packed with great tech, like Windows 10 Home, WIFI 6 or Wi-Fi 802.11ax support, whatever you want to call it, Bluetooth 5.0, 2 USB, Media Card Reader, USB C, which can also be used to for charging as well, and a charging port. One thing I have to say that most people are getting away from and I am glad that Microsoft decided to keep is the headphone jack, built into the tablet. Most people don^t like or care for the headphone jacks but I personally love them because in a pinch they do come in handy. The laptop also comes with a front and rear camera, which by the way worked well during my office meetings, along with the Dolby Atmos audio which is not bad at all. The screen resolution on the laptop is amazing (3240 x 2160), and the touch screen is very responsive.As far as performance goes, while the Surface 3 is not built for gaming, it does allow and runs some performance requiring game such as tomb raider, Modern Warefare without any problems. Also, working of some 3D designing rendering, video editing, and using photoshop the laptop performed without a hitch and did not heat up, which my other laptop still does but it is also older and lags a bit behind in hardware. My overall experience with the Microsoft Surface Book 3 has been nothing but amazing. Although being a very expensive unit, I believe it is well worth the price. Like the saying goes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂYou get what you pay forÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. If anyone is looking for tablet/pc, I would recommend looking into the Surface Book 3.",5,positive,The Person likes the processing power of the Surface Book 3 to edit media.,"working of some 3D designing rendering, video editing, and using photoshop the laptop performed without a hitch and did not heat up",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/8f7d6786bae35fd4315a2a2a7bf9e727,2021-01-28T22:10:47,"Also, working of some 3D designing rendering, video editing, and using photoshop the laptop performed without a hitch and did not heat up, which my other laptop still does but it is also older and lags a bit behind in hardware.",EditAction,Action Exist

The main areas I felt needed the most attention was centered around design and performance decisions made by Microsoft to keep the Surface Book 3 ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂthe premierÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 2-in-1 notebook in the market. The detachable tablet design results in a lot of sacrifices to maintain that unique form factor. There was a noticeable amount of screen wobble due to the top end heavy design of the display. Audio and sound takes a minor performance hit due to the relatively weak and hollow sounding speakers embedded into the display unit (but not the base unit oddly). More importantly, while I found the unit whisper quiet under normal operation ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it got notably noisy, and even a little whiny, under full sustained processing loads, such as encoding in Adobe Premier Pro, or while testing out the graphical processing prowess in some light gaming action in Fortnite. Sadly, all of the currently available configurations are non-user serviceable/ non upgradable which means that you need to seriously calculate the amount of RAM and SSD storage you may need for future application usage and development ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ or risk having to acquire a whole new unit later on down the line.Detailed Observations after a regular usage:===================================================My team and I create training photos, video content, coded programs, and virtualized network/server infrastructure to meet our organization^s needs.

In all honesty, I feel that if you are planning on working with predominately RAW Images or any 16bpc (or greater) JPG images AND/OR rely on more than 10 layers ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ you should definitely be looking at the Surface Book 3 with 32GB of RAM over this configuration.

I have been a Mac guy for the past 10 years but the Surface Book 3 has changed the game for me and made me realize that I still have a love for the Windows OS. For the longest time I haven^t understood why Apple couldn^t make a Tablet/Laptop that has a touchscreen and laptop functionality. Microsoft has basically solved that and then some with this computer. I was sent the Surface Book 3 to evaluate because I am a reviewer in an invitation-only program and am provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews, but that definitely has zero effect on how much I love this computer! I am a professional photographer so I was very interested in having a portable editable laptop with the functionality of a touchscreen tablet.Initial setup and presentation of the SB3 was very good. It took only a few minutes to get everything up and operational. Windows 10 is very user friendly and easy to navigate. This particular model is an i7 with a 256 gb SSD, 16GB of Ram, and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 6GB GPU which for any normal computer is an absolute beast let alone a portable laptop/tablet. The unit is robust and sleek, keyboard is responsive and had a good feel to it and touchpad works as expected. Performance wise the two things that I noticed right away that are different from my MacBook Pro is that the SB3 runs virtually silent and very very cool. If I do anything labor intensive on my MacBook it sounds like a jet engine is taking off. My main editing programs for photos are Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. I usually tend to push my machines to the limits by exporting photos and editing at the same time and the SB3 handles everything beautifully. What made it even more impressive is while doing all these labor intensive tasks I can DETACH the unit from the keyboard and take it with me to the couch. I went ahead and purchased the Surface Pen to use for editing and I have to say it is an amazing companion to the tablet feature of the SB3. It detects when your pen hovers above the screen and allows you to really edit photos down to a very fine degree. For photoshop its particularly helpful to make tight selections or edit out flyways or other imperfections. While using the pen it almost feels like I^m painting which has become a more a nice change for me with editing.

The unit is robust and sleek, keyboard is responsive and had a good feel to it and touchpad works as expected. Performance wise the two things that I noticed right away that are different from my MacBook Pro is that the SB3 runs virtually silent and very very cool.

The version I recieved is the 15"" 4k screen with pixelsense, 16gb ram and 256gb solid state drive with an Nvidia graphics card that has it""s own dedicated memory. I find that a nice plus out of the box compared to most of the competition using an integrated graphics card. This does not have any optane memory listed like others, but this still starts up quick and loads programs fast. Granted solid states do load very quick, and is faster than the desktop I have with standard 7200rpm hard drives (it""s only 2 years old). This has facial recognition lock, but I chose not to set this up because I sometimes need others to get stuff for me, and If I""m having someone do that, I don""t want any delays. Generally I""ll be the only user, and I""m not doing top secret work or anything that is needing that extra security.So using this, the mousepad is responsive and intuitive, but I did prefer using a separate mouse. The keyboard is a good size, nice feel to the keys, and I adjust quickly to the smaller size vs my desktop keyboard. The touch screen is phenomenal. I""ve used this with Adobe Photoshop and to zoom in and see stuff at this level of detail is excellent to crop or touch up photos. Cropping, loading editing, and transferring photos for me goes smoothly, no hiccups. I also have used my external Blu-ray drive/burners to burn DVD""s quickly with this using Nero software. I have even done it from one drive to the other having 2 burners hooked up at once to see if this machine can do it, and it does. I have also taken several old recordings and used Nero wav editor to cut out lead ins and such to clean the recordings up and splice them together and get them on CD for permanent storage. What can I say, I""m still a bit old school and don""t 100% trust my whole life to be in a cloud in digital. The Dolby Atmos sound is very good, I have not had a laptop with this good of built in sound ever. I have some 5.1mix sacd""s and DTS mixed albums and I am very pleased with this. Watching movies in Atmos is great, I am able to duplicate my home theater system on my laptop. Doing all this stuff on this computer, I see no lags in transitions or if I have 2 or more things toggling between. I have also utilized this for several driving games in tablet form and notebook form, no stalling and gaming play is responsive, no lag and great clarity. I also use this to work for home doing telehealth clinic, and it""s important to work and not have any lag. This does the trick, with the only lag I have is the network I have to use.So, positives of this, no lags, glitches, things load fast what I""ve thrown at it, it takes it without issues. Start up and shut down is quick. Set up was quick, and I got all my programs loaded promptly. The display and ability to zoom on details with great resolution allows more precise edits. The sound is excellent for a laptop. The build quality is solid, nice to feel metal-like feel in my hands, sturdy. I have not had a chance to really test the battery life, but what I""ve seen so far, not sure if it""s as good as the claim, It dropped 60% in 3 hours of use recently with autodim screen brightness, and recommended power mode. Again, I have not tested officially tested it for duration of how long it could run, but I question if it would make the 17 hours claim unless in the stingiest of settings. It does look like it has some type of dual battery system.Negatives, no real complaints other than retail cost, this seems like it""s very expensive compared to several models from competitors being very competable. However, most of those do not have the dedicated graphics, and this has better cameras on the front (full HD) and back (good for my video conference). I""m also not sure battery life is as good as they advertise. This also has really good sound, not sure how those others stack up.I feel one thing this presents is backing by the manufacturer that made the operating system. That being so, I hope it means future obsoleteness by software is minimal and they will be on top of updates for this and keep the drivers for they equipment in future windows releases. Plus tech support appears to be redily available for up to 1 year, which I hope to not have to use (things continue tol run well). That in and of itself is a benefit, usually extras for other companies.I would recommend this for a person who needs to make sure they have a system that is stable, compatible.

No lags, stutters, pauses or anything of the sort. I did have an issue with a driver file installed by Premiere causing Windows not to boot. It took a full Windows restore with assistance from Microsoft and a couple of hours of my time to resolve. Fortunately, being a brand-new setup I did not lose anything other than my time. The NVIDIA GPU did not seem to be getting used initially for the software I was using. Had to go into NVIDIA control panel and change Global 3D setting for preferred graphics processor from Auto-select to High-performance and then I could see in task manager that it was doing some work. From watching the performance in Windows task manager, it does not seem as if my productivity software was really pushing the Nvidia GPU very much, so I installed a couple of different video games to push it a little harder. The GTX 1660 is a high-end graphics chip set and it handled Forza Horizon 4 without problem. With the video settings on ultra it was able to maintain 30 fps and on high about 45 fps. I never really heard the internal fan get too loud, but the base does get a bit warm when the GPU is running hard. Being magnesium, the case seems to dissipate the heat rather well. Under normal used base and tablet are always cool to the touch.There are 2 batteries, one in the screen/tablet and one in the base. When attached it uses the base battery, which is larger first, and after reaching a certain charge level will then draw from both batteries which is a nice feature. I really didn^t have a chance to test out Microsoft^s 17.5 hour battery life claim but was able to use a full day off and on with a single charge. The battery does drain noticeably faster when using the GPU heavily though. Charge time from 20% to full was about 1 ÃÂÃÂ½ hoursThe 256GB disk storage in this configuration is a bit on the light side especially if doing a lot of creative work, you^ll quickly fill up your drive storing media and other resources. Fortunately, the Surface Book has an SD card reader, so I added a 256GB card and formatted it HPFS for added semi-permanent storage. One downside is the card reader is rather shallow causing the card to stick out quite a bit and was a bit concerning for me to leave in all the time. Happily, I found an adapter for the Surface Book made by Baseqi that uses a micro SD mounted sideways to fit flush against the Surface housing when inserted.The backlit keyboard is great. Has a nice feel with appropriate key travel and tactile feedback. Layout and key spacing are also excellent.I^m not a big fan of touch pads in general. I think some people feel that the Surface^s pad should be larger more like a MacBook, but I feel this one is about right for my taste. It also does a good job of ignoring inadvertent touches (palm or thumb) while typing. I^ve used other laptops where the cursor annoyingly jumps around because of that.Detaching is a very simple process, just press the button and the Surface lets you know when it is ready. If there are any resources in the base being used it lets you know what must be closed or stopped before detaching. Once ready you easily lift the screen up to remove from the base. Using the tablet by itself is not a bad experience despite Window 10^s subpar tablet mode. It^s large but not too heavy and has a nice balance to it.

Upon opening the packaging was sleek and functional and easy to deal with. The device instantly felt good in my hands and when I opened it the hinge operated smoothly and with little force but still holds it""s position very well. This is a very well engineered product. The charging puck has a USB port for charging another device. This means when I travel I don""t need to bring an extra charger - fantastic. The charging cable attaches magnetically to either the base or the tablet. The keyboard feels very comfortable and has a large and sensitive touch pad. This is the first laptop that has a keyboard that is a pleasure to use and although I could hook up an auxiliary unit I didn""t feel the need what so ever. Detaching the base is like magic. Hold the detach button for a few seconds and the screen indicates it is ""Ready to Detach."" With a gentle tug the pieces separate. Joining them together is as simple as placing the tablet back in place and the pieces ""know"" it is time to ""be one"" again. Once joined the connection is as solid as a permanent hinge. In fact I thought that it was a laptop and not a convertible until I found the detach button. The tablet is remarkably light and the touch screen is responsive and gives a sharp beautiful picture. As for sound, I don""t think I would use this for a boom box but it is the best sounding laptop or tablet I have had in my hands and quite frankly sounds better than one of my stand alone monitors. As for performance, this thing rocks! I am not a professional but I do video and photo editing and once I got over the excitement of holding if for the first time I got to business and installed my video and photo editing software. Some of my devices can barely run them - this is the fastest computer in my collection. Video rendering was fast and I could multitask at the same time with no noticeable degradation in performance.

It is a beautiful piece of technology, packed with features and capabilities. I have spent over a week with the 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ version, using it at work, home, and school.The version I am reviewing has the Intel i7-1065G7 chip with a base frequency of 1.3 GHz and a turbo capability of up to 3.9 GHz. The included i7 is a 10th generation processer, from the end of 2019. While it is not the top Ice Lake processor that Intel puts out, it is still well-specced. My version also came with 16 GB of RAM.Graphics are handled by a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti card with 6 GB of GDDR6 and Max-Q Design. All the Max-Q version means is that the graphics card runs cooler, consumes less power, and as a result runs slower than its desktop variant. That is to be expected, however, as the Surface Book 3 is a laptop/tablet/portable device, and as such, does not have space or power to mount a large graphics card. The display is gorgeous. Microsoft calls it the PixelSense display, and it is beautiful, with a 3,240 x 2,160-pixel resolution. The display is not your typical 16:9 display but is instead a 3:2 ratio. I like the change over my previous laptops, all of which were 16:9 displays. It seems like I can see more top to bottom on web pages and documents without having to scroll. Brightness was more than enough for me. I did not have to turn the display all the way up as I have on my other laptops, some of which still seemed too dim after that. The Surface Book 3 had no issues going bright.The screen can be detached from the keyboard and used on its own. Pressing the dock key on the upper right part of the keyboard or using your mouse pointer to select the detach icon in the status bar of Windows unlocks the screen and allows it to be removed.Charging is handled by Microsoft^s magnetic clip charger, the same as on their other Surface products. It clicks right into place and stays there but comes free easily enough if you forget to disconnect it before walking away with the Surface Book 3.I am in the second year of my Ph.D. studies, and as you might imagine, the amount of typing a student has to do is pretty incredible. I have gone through a couple of laptops over the last two years, trying to find a typing keyboard that doesn^t make my wrists, hands, and fingers ache after a couple of hours of use. I^ve tried products from several of the main name brands, and while the keyboards were ok, I never felt like anyone of them provided the solution that I needed. At least until the Surface Book 3. The keyboard on this unit is fantastic. The keys are reassuringly springy, but not too much so. The layout feels natural to my large hands, and I can type for hours without getting exhausted. One of my favorite aspects of typing on the Surface Book 3 is how cool the keyboard remains. Other laptops I have had run from warm to extremely warm under the keyboard. There is nothing worse than having to type with sweaty hands! This not a problem on the Surface Book 3. There is no heat emanating from the keyboard, and it was refreshingly cool to place the hands back on after taking a break from typing.The trackpad is one of the best I have ever used, right on par with my wife^s Mac Book Pro 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. Finger movements on it are slick and smooth, and it is very accurate. The touch screen works perfectly fine, whether in tablet or laptop mode.Battery life was better by far than a standard laptop, while not as good as a couple of tablets I have. Running a variety of programs, with Wi-Fi on and display just under full brightness, I got about eight hours of battery life. That is with the tablet docked on the keyboard and the backlit keyboard on. I^m sure if I had switched to airplane mode and turned the brightness down to 50%, I could have doubled the battery life. Still, 8 hours of life with the way I was running the Surface Book 3 was fantastic, in my opinion. It nearly doubled the battery life of one of my newer HP Envy laptops and came in just under the battery life I get from an expensive tablet I have.While I would never be likely to use the Surface Book 3 as a gaming laptop, I thought I^d give the Nvidia card a workout. My son played games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands, and Fortnight on it. We usually got around 40 FPS from all three games during the heaviest action scenes. Not as good as a dedicated gaming laptop, of course, but not bad either.Processor performance was, for the most part, exceptional. 99% of my time with the Surface Book 3 demonstrated a computer that was snappy, agile, and quick, but there were a few times I got it to slow and bog down. My job requires me to run statistical analysis programs to determine future water use for the city I live in. I run the program in Windows, load in a multitude of variables, upload a huge database, and then run models. Heavy stat analysis and modeling can bog a CPU down, particularly if the cores of the processor get warm, and the system dials back the power and speed of processing to compensate. I wonder if that is what happened to the Surface Book 3 while I was using it. Compared to the other computers I use to run statistical analysis, the Surface Book 3 struggled a little with the statistical modeling program. I wonder if the 32 GB version of the Surface Book 3 would have fared better, as the lagginess could very well have something to do with the lower RAM in my model.For a hobby, I re-master and record audio, converting it into DSD files for archiving. I have a high-powered gaming laptop that I use specifically for this work, as it takes a lot of processing power to do the conversions in a relatively quick amount of time. It is a big, bulky unit, however, and I^d love to switch it out for something as portable as the Surface Book 3. The good news is converting a 5.1 raw WAV file into a multichannel DSD file took around the same amount of time with the Surface Book 3 as it did with the high-powered gaming laptop. This was a real surprise to me; I thought the gaming laptop would blow the Surface Book 3 away.Overall, my experience with the Surface Book 3 has been excellent. It is a dream to type on, has an amazingly vibrant and crisp display, has great battery life, good connectivity options, and is an every-day use product. It runs cool, so it can sit on your lap for hours as you type, or you can detach the screen and use it as a tablet. I didn^t find graphics performance lacking, and the processor, for the most part, performed exceptionally well.

10010,10010,1852,"Microsoft - Surface Book 3 15"" Touch-Screen PixelSenseÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ - 2-in-1 Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 256GB SSD - Platinum",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/SLZ_00001,RecordAction,Person,Universal,ProcessingPower,"Few electronics in my house have been as anxiously awaited as the new Microsoft Surface Book 3. It is a beautiful piece of technology, packed with features and capabilities. I have spent over a week with the 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ version, using it at work, home, and school.The version I am reviewing has the Intel i7-1065G7 chip with a base frequency of 1.3 GHz and a turbo capability of up to 3.9 GHz. The included i7 is a 10th generation processer, from the end of 2019. While it is not the top Ice Lake processor that Intel puts out, it is still well-specced. My version also came with 16 GB of RAM.Graphics are handled by a GeForce GTX 1660 Ti card with 6 GB of GDDR6 and Max-Q Design. All the Max-Q version means is that the graphics card runs cooler, consumes less power, and as a result runs slower than its desktop variant. That is to be expected, however, as the Surface Book 3 is a laptop/tablet/portable device, and as such, does not have space or power to mount a large graphics card. The display is gorgeous. Microsoft calls it the PixelSense display, and it is beautiful, with a 3,240 x 2,160-pixel resolution. The display is not your typical 16:9 display but is instead a 3:2 ratio. I like the change over my previous laptops, all of which were 16:9 displays. It seems like I can see more top to bottom on web pages and documents without having to scroll. Brightness was more than enough for me. I did not have to turn the display all the way up as I have on my other laptops, some of which still seemed too dim after that. The Surface Book 3 had no issues going bright.The screen can be detached from the keyboard and used on its own. Pressing the dock key on the upper right part of the keyboard or using your mouse pointer to select the detach icon in the status bar of Windows unlocks the screen and allows it to be removed.Charging is handled by Microsoft^s magnetic clip charger, the same as on their other Surface products. It clicks right into place and stays there but comes free easily enough if you forget to disconnect it before walking away with the Surface Book 3.I am in the second year of my Ph.D. studies, and as you might imagine, the amount of typing a student has to do is pretty incredible. I have gone through a couple of laptops over the last two years, trying to find a typing keyboard that doesn^t make my wrists, hands, and fingers ache after a couple of hours of use. I^ve tried products from several of the main name brands, and while the keyboards were ok, I never felt like anyone of them provided the solution that I needed. At least until the Surface Book 3. The keyboard on this unit is fantastic. The keys are reassuringly springy, but not too much so. The layout feels natural to my large hands, and I can type for hours without getting exhausted. One of my favorite aspects of typing on the Surface Book 3 is how cool the keyboard remains. Other laptops I have had run from warm to extremely warm under the keyboard. There is nothing worse than having to type with sweaty hands! This not a problem on the Surface Book 3. There is no heat emanating from the keyboard, and it was refreshingly cool to place the hands back on after taking a break from typing.The trackpad is one of the best I have ever used, right on par with my wife^s Mac Book Pro 15ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ. Finger movements on it are slick and smooth, and it is very accurate. The touch screen works perfectly fine, whether in tablet or laptop mode.Battery life was better by far than a standard laptop, while not as good as a couple of tablets I have. Running a variety of programs, with Wi-Fi on and display just under full brightness, I got about eight hours of battery life. That is with the tablet docked on the keyboard and the backlit keyboard on. I^m sure if I had switched to airplane mode and turned the brightness down to 50%, I could have doubled the battery life. Still, 8 hours of life with the way I was running the Surface Book 3 was fantastic, in my opinion. It nearly doubled the battery life of one of my newer HP Envy laptops and came in just under the battery life I get from an expensive tablet I have.While I would never be likely to use the Surface Book 3 as a gaming laptop, I thought I^d give the Nvidia card a workout. My son played games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Borderlands, and Fortnight on it. We usually got around 40 FPS from all three games during the heaviest action scenes. Not as good as a dedicated gaming laptop, of course, but not bad either.Processor performance was, for the most part, exceptional. 99% of my time with the Surface Book 3 demonstrated a computer that was snappy, agile, and quick, but there were a few times I got it to slow and bog down. My job requires me to run statistical analysis programs to determine future water use for the city I live in. I run the program in Windows, load in a multitude of variables, upload a huge database, and then run models. Heavy stat analysis and modeling can bog a CPU down, particularly if the cores of the processor get warm, and the system dials back the power and speed of processing to compensate. I wonder if that is what happened to the Surface Book 3 while I was using it. Compared to the other computers I use to run statistical analysis, the Surface Book 3 struggled a little with the statistical modeling program. I wonder if the 32 GB version of the Surface Book 3 would have fared better, as the lagginess could very well have something to do with the lower RAM in my model.For a hobby, I re-master and record audio, converting it into DSD files for archiving. I have a high-powered gaming laptop that I use specifically for this work, as it takes a lot of processing power to do the conversions in a relatively quick amount of time. It is a big, bulky unit, however, and I^d love to switch it out for something as portable as the Surface Book 3. The good news is converting a 5.1 raw WAV file into a multichannel DSD file took around the same amount of time with the Surface Book 3 as it did with the high-powered gaming laptop. This was a real surprise to me; I thought the gaming laptop would blow the Surface Book 3 away.Overall, my experience with the Surface Book 3 has been excellent. It is a dream to type on, has an amazingly vibrant and crisp display, has great battery life, good connectivity options, and is an every-day use product. It runs cool, so it can sit on your lap for hours as you type, or you can detach the screen and use it as a tablet. I didn^t find graphics performance lacking, and the processor, for the most part, performed exceptionally well. The Surface Book 3 is now my go-to laptop, and I actually look forward to being able to use it each day. I can^t think of a better endorsement than that.Note: I am a member of the Best Buy Tech Insider Network.

Reviewers in this invitation-only program are provided products for the purpose of writing honest, unbiased reviews. My review has not been impacted by the fact that I""ve not had to pay for it. With that out of the way...The latest Surface Book is a well refined package that does a lot of things well. Aesthetics, usability, and build quality come together to deliver a nearly perfect machine, let down by an underwhelming CPU choice and lack of storage (on this particular configuration). It""s in a class of its own in terms of design, and would work well for anyone needing a portable design capable machine, but the performance brings into question whether the design is worth the trade offs. Let""s dive in.The screen is absolutely stunning. To my eyes, it""s perfect for anyone into content creation (which this machine is undeniably targeted towards). Colors are vivid, blacks are deep black (very little to no backlight bleed, which typically drives me nuts with laptop displays), and the resolution (4K) is predictably stunning on a screen of this size. Making things all the better is the fact that you can detach the screen from the body and use it like a tablet. The 15"" variant here is admittedly a little large for the type of usage I get out of it, but I could see this being a giant selling point to anyone doing graphic design and desiring a more slate like setup. The detaching mechanism works pretty flawlessly; you press the detach button on the keyboard, wait a second, and you get a visual prompt that the screen is ready to detach. That""s it. In cases where you""re using an application that""s taking advantage of the discrete GPU inside the keyboard, you""ll get a prompt notifying you to deal with whatever you""re doing there before you can detach. This is a great feature that Microsoft absolutely nailed here with the Surface Book 3, giving you the usability of a keyboard with a powerful GPU teamed with a flexibility and mobility of a tablet.Speaking of the keyboard, it is simply put the best laptop keyboard I""ve ever typed on. Anyone needing a laptop with which to do hours of typing will not be disappointed. The keys are comfortable and have a reassuring amount of travel that really makes it a joy to type on. Similarly, the touch pad also works VERY well, though the small size is quite puzzling to me. There is a lot of real estate available below the keyboard that could""ve been used to expand the pad, and the Surface Book would""ve been well served utilizing said space. Also on the input front... No pen included?! To be frank, this laptop is simply too expensive to not bundle the pen in. This is becoming something of a norm, as other competitors have opted to include it (my personal experience being with the HP x360 Spectre). Again, as I see this being geared primarily towards graphic designers and content creators, I feel like it""s a big miss of them to not include it here. One other note; while this laptop includes a headphone jack, it""s located in the upper right hand side of the screen. I know the overall trends say that most people will be using bluetooth headphones, but this placement is actually a pretty major annoyance since your cord is constantly in the way unless you tuck it under the laptop. It""s a small but annoying quirk.After using my Surface Book 3 for a week, the main issue I""ve run into is the included amount of storage on this particular configuration. In 2020, 256 GB does not cut it, especially considering Windows 10 cuts a decent chunk of that storage before you""ve installed a single program. Reiterating the fact that this machine is targeted towards content creators, it""s easy to see a scenario where you""ll run out of room quite quickly if you do any sort of video or photo editing. While you can obviously supplement with an external drive, that""s an unnecessary added cost and pain point in my opinion, and because of the sleek and innovative design of the Surface Book 3, there is ZERO ability to upgrade any of the internal components. What you buy is what you""ll be stuck with permanently. Consider that carefully before making your choice.The other main issue I have with the Surface Book 3, which applies across the all versions and not just this particular configuration, is the processor. Quite frankly, I""m disappointed in the performance of the CPU Microsoft chose to put into this computer. It feels under powered in multimedia tasks, especially when considered next to the included Nvidia GPU. Upon booting it up for the first time, I was actually fairly disappointed in general system responsiveness; turning the machine on takes longer than I""d expect given the solid state drive, and even something as straight forward as watching a 4K video on YouTube caused some scroll lag in Chrome. Scrubbing in Adobe Premiere and scrolling in Photoshop both exhibit disheartening amounts of lag; it""ll be enough to slow down professional editors, but will be more of a mere annoyance to prosumer/hobbyists like myself. Thus far, I""ve attempted some video editing using Premiere and some cell phone shot 4K clips; one particular test I ran was to apply a noise reduction filter (high setting) to a 2:12 length, 4K (~50mbps) MP4 clip, which took about 11 minutes total to complete and was a completely CPU bound task, with a max boost clock of 2.06 GHz. This may give you a bit of a sense of what kind of power we""re looking at with the CPU. The Surface Book 3 does the job, but it doesn""t do it exactly admirably. Editing photos in Photoshop is a mostly similar experience, especially with RAW images; adding layers and effects to images just isn""t as snappy as it feels like it should be. Overall, I""d sum the CPU up as usable but a bit disappointing.Whereas the CPU is a letdown on the Surface Book 3, the GPU (the very capable GTX 1660 TI Max Q) is the strong point of the computer. It offers up a good amount of horsepower for scenarios ranging from media rendering to gaming. On the topic of gaming, some might be interested to find that my machine scored a 4877 run in Time Spy (3dmark) on a near fresh Windows install, out of the box with latest Nvidia drivers. There are better options for gaming for less money, but realistically, that""s not why you""re buying this machine anyhow. Overall, the Surface Book 3""s gaming acumen is a great added bonus, held back completely by the absolute dearth of storage on this particularly model, especially considering new games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare are pushing or exceeding 200 GB install sizes (making the 256 GB of storage available here a non-starter in that case). Again, consider your needs carefully before deciding on a trim level.Build quality on the Surface Book 3 is overall top notch. Everything here feels like an ultra premium laptop and compares favorably to my Mac Book Pro (circa mid-2019). The only somewhat questionable design aspect comes from the hinge; it operates well, but the screen is fairly heavy, meaning the machine is not only top heavy in the lap (set it in your lap and it""ll start rocking a bit backwards), the hinge ""wobbles"" a bit when you move the laptop around. Usually this would bother me, but given the hinge mechanism in place here, it""s not a big deal honestly since the detach/attaching mechanism works so well.The TL;DR here is that if you""re a content creator looking for the flexibility of a tablet but with the power of a discrete GPU for powerful media rendering that could also allow for some decent gaming, this is likely the only game in town. However, consider both the fact that CPU is slightly underwhelming and that you will forever be stuck with the hardware you buy up front and in this case the 256 GB hard drive kills this build for me. Overall, this is a premium machine that checks most of the boxes, but it""s hard for me to overlook those two downfalls.",4,neutral,The Person is a bit disappointed with the performance of this laptop to edit photos.,"Editing photos in Photoshop is a mostly similar experience, especially with RAW images; adding layers and effects to images just isn""t as snappy as it feels like it should be.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/39c7b61f1c2afbe991c1d764b6320782,2021-02-08T20:40:44,"Editing photos in Photoshop is a mostly similar experience, especially with RAW images; adding layers and effects to images just isn""t as snappy as it feels like it should be.",EditAction,Action Exist

For the gamer in our home, high speed and picture quality take the experience to the right level. Both the keyboard and the screen/tablet became hot while gaming.For the art enthusiast in our home, having front and rear facing cameras as well as Paint 3D and 3D viewer to assist in photo editing, the touch screen surface with pen option makes this a nice tool to get creative with. I like the quality of the pictures I took of myself. They seem to be in matte format and are rather flattering.Playing videos and listening to music were of good quality.For my budding architect, we downloaded Autocad LT and let the building take off. The processing speed seems to be quite reactive to the time the screen gets touched. We didn^t experience any lag, at least none we could notice which to us translates into no lag. The crisp screen display enhances the architectural visuals and leaving your work to the imagination is a thing of the past when you can clearly see your creation come to life with amazing resolution. The surface comes with two batteries, one in the keyboard and one in the tablet/screen. Naturally something needs to continue to power the tablet once its been ejected. Yes, there^s an eject button on the keyboard so you may want to make those button happy aware that once that button is pressed it will release the tablet/screen from the keyboard and will be loose and needs to be removed or snapped back on.The keyboard lights up which is a fav feature of mine in any computer. I tend to burn the midnight oil but don^t like to work with overhead lights, so being able to see my keyboard is important. The keyboard has 3 levels of light intensity.The screen also can be brightened easily with tapping the screen.Like I said, the surface is very reactive. Almost like it knows what I plan to do before I do it.The computer stays cool during normal use but under gaming conditions gets hot. The battery seemed to last quite a bit when using software other than gaming and/or surfing the internet.The charger has a slim rectangular magnetic feature which attaches and detached easily from its port.I like the design of the surface as it doesn^t weigh down heavily on my lap.

I think this is a laptop geared toward productivity, but that can also handle video and photo files very well and is an excellent choice for tasks such as web surfing, video conferencing and spreadsheets as well as gaming up to the highest settings on many games. It is not exceptionally noisy, it doesn^t seem to slow down because of heating issues and the battery will stay with you a pretty long time with moderate use. This is an extremely nice laptop with one defining feature ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the removable screen. If this feature is important to you, there is not another laptop like it on the market. Up front, I received my Microsoft Surface Book 3 as part of the Best Buy Tech Insider Network which is an invitation only program that provides products to reviewers in return for our honest, unbiased review.First off, the surface book 3 looks exactly like the previous version. I don^t consider that a bad thing, however. This laptop feels as premium as any you will find at nearly any price. It is a well-built laptop. There are two full size USB ports, one USB c port and a full-size SD card slot along with the Microsoft surface plug. The laptop has a removable screen, same as the last model (but I hear they are not interchangeable) and a very good keyboard that is a pleasure to use. The screen is very good although Microsoft still tends to have large boarders around the screen (necessary when using the screen as a tablet). Colors are very nice and touch sensitivity is as good as any laptop you will find. The laptop also has Bluetooth 5 on board and Wi-Fi 6.The keyboard does not take up the full area of the laptop. It would seem to me that Microsoft could have added a number pad and made full use of all that space. The mouse pad seems small by todays standards, but it is exceptionally responsive and has a great feel to it. The keyboard also has excellent feel to the keys.My particular unit is the basic 15-inch model. The one I have is sporting 16 gig of Ram and a 256 gig SSD drive. The processor is a 10th generation Intel core i7, quad core, and the video card is the NVidia 1660 ti Max-Q which is a very good mid-range video editing/gaming type card. You can spec this same unit with up to 32 gig of ram and at least a 2TB SSD drive. I would strongly suggest looking at a unit with a larger SSD drive. Once you install the Microsoft office sweet, some adobe software and freeware programs used for video and photo editing and a couple of games, you have pretty much used up your 256 gig drive and there is little to no room for video or photo files that you may want to work on.Using readily available software such as handbrake and MakeMKV along with software from the Adobe creative cloud such as Adobe media encoder, photoshop and Adobe premiere pro, the surface book 3 was very good, but not blazing fast. The CPU (it is good) is still somewhat limiting. The CPU used in this laptop is a quad core intel chip operating at 15watts. There are 6 and even 8 core chips available that would do a better job with CPU intensive programs but at the cost of battery life and more heat and would cause the Microsoft surface book 3 to lose its defining feature - the removable screen. The CPU for the surface is located in the screen so that you can use the screen as a tablet. As an example, I matched my surface up to my fairly high-end gaming laptop that I traditionally use for working on photo and video files. The surface was not able to keep up with the gamer, however, it still had a very respectable showing. In-fact it did well enough that I will be using the surface to do much of my work, especially with the added benefit of the touch screen and surface pen to assist with photoshop projects. The gaming unit with the higher watt CPU also only offers about 2 hours of battery life and is very loud compared to the surface. I think the benefits offered by the surface book outweigh the performance loss from using the lower wattage CPU. The low watt CPU is this computers Achilles heel, but the GPU is its saving grace. Programs that can take advantage of the very impressive GPU ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the Nvidia 1660Ti Max-Q that is installed in my version of the laptop run very smoothly and at more than acceptable speeds. I saw no slowdown at all working with video files in Adobe Premiere and working with images in photoshop was fun to do. It is also this very good GPU (video card) that actually makes the surface book 3 a pretty good laptop for people who want to be able to take a break from work and just fire up some games. Games such as Fortnite, Battlefield, Unreal tournament, Half-life 2 and darkest hour run at 1080p on high settings with more than acceptable frame rates. The surface book 3 is a laptop that is geared to productivity. It handles photo and video editing tasks using Adobe and similar software packages very well, video conferencing and Microsoft office tasks like a champ. Video conferencing on the beautiful surface book screen is actually a pleasure and the 1080p front facing camera is definitely a plus and It can even double as a pretty good gaming machine on almost any graphics intensive game out there. But let^s face facts here. The number one feature that separates this laptop from all others is its ability to separate the screen from the keyboard so that you have a really nice tablet that you can use for watching videos or working with photoshop and other software away from the keyboard (realize that you will lose the discreet GPU). The surface book is the only laptop that offers this feature. It is quiet, runs pretty cool and in my experience will give you at least an 8 to 10-hour battery life with fairly heavy use. One disappointment is the lack of a surface pen. I happen to have a surface pen that I use with my other Microsoft products, but if you don^t already have one, be prepared to purchase one. Its kind of a shame the pen is not included because one of the really neat things you can do with the surface book 3 is to remove the screen and place it on backwards. This allows you to lean the screen back with the keyboard out of the way in order to use the screen as a canvas or to use the surface pen to work with photoshop projects.Its priced like a top tier machine and in almost every case, it also performs as one. I would love to have a little faster CPU, but the option of having both a laptop and a tablet in one unit that is as capable as this laptop iis definitely worth the trade-off.",5,positive,The user likes the touchscreen of the Surface Book 3 to use for photoshop.,"In-fact it did well enough that I will be using the surface to do much of my work, especially with the added benefit of the touch screen and surface pen to assist with photoshop projects.",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/2ef0f8944b719ced6ae981915291638c,2021-02-12T17:20:08,"In-fact it did well enough that I will be using the surface to do much of my work, especially with the added benefit of the touch screen and surface pen to assist with photoshop projects.",EditAction,Action Exist

The main hinge is robust and there""s very little to no flex but there""s a little bit of flex from the secondary pivot point when you""re converting it between modes but I don""t think that""s a big deal at all.This is the Core i7 version that I have with 16GB RAM and a 512 GB SSD HD. 1TB of storage would offer a bit more headroom but for the most part the 1/2 TB works. However, the i7 processor and 16GB of RAM has proved to be plenty for plenty of apps being open at one time and it has never bogged down, even while having dozens of Google Chrome tabs open.One odd thing is that when it""s in tablet mode, it""s not perfectly flat - the display sits at a slight angle. It""s nothing that affects the use of it in tablet mode but just something you may want to be aware of.Also to note, although it has two USB C ports with USB 4.0 and Thunderbolt 4, that""s all you get other than a headphone jack (and power), so you may require a dongle depending on your needs.I""m very impressed with this device. If I were to judge it as just a laptop, I think it""s great. A good keyboard, trackpad, and display. Then factor in the touchscreen, the stage mode, as well as the tablet mode, along with the Surface Pen, and for me this has actually addressed my need for a true all in one.",5,positive,The user likes the touchscreen and surface pen of this laptop.,"Along with the touchscreen there""s also the Surface Pen and this adds yet another way to interact with the device and it""s very precise",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/756842effbf365864447cb437f4048ef,2021-11-30T07:32:18,"The touchscreen is obviously a must in tablet or stage mode but I do also find it nice to have in laptop mode.Along with the touchscreen there""s also the Surface Pen and this adds yet another way to interact with the device and it""s very precise.",WriteAction,Action Exist

The combination of features with the capability unlocked by the convertible screen and in particular if you add the slim pen 2 make for a compelling product that is a standout among the newest additions to the surface lineup. As I have been using this computer, I have been continually impressed by what it offers, and it keeps surprising me on a daily basis. I was concerned at first that it would be too large and heavy for my preferences based on the specs I saw. Thankfully, I feel it is just right. It is a bit heavy to be sure but that is only due to the quality of its construction with all the machined aluminum and the size of the screen. Speaking of the screen, it is gorgeous, 120hz PixelSense with HDR. Everything looks crisp and colors are vibrant and accurate. The refresh rate makes a big difference with how smooth everything looks on screen from animations to video playback and even gaming. Gaming is made possible by the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti, which is a good match for this screen and will run many games at high settings. I for example ran Forza Horizon 4 on high settings with full resolution and was seeing 50-60fps while running on battery and saw a little under 2 hours of life playing that way. For a laptop that isn^t designated as a gaming rig I feel that is very respectable and makes it even more of an all-in-one device. I have not attempted to see if my framerate changes at all while plugged in, but I would not be surprised if it improved. Regular use with videos, browsing, document creation etc. is where the battery life really shines, I have seen over 8 full hours of life out of it without the need to plug in. Charging is done via the included special magnetic charger which has a USB-A port for charging an additional device. It is quick and easy to use. Charging is also thankfully possible using the thunderbolt ports as well, which I am very grateful for. I have a monitor that has USB type C input for video, and reverse charging for the connected device which I really love using, and this laptop works flawlessly with that monitor and takes a charge from it via that USB-C connection. The keyboard and touchpad are also excellent. For a laptop keyboard it has good key travel and does not require excessive force to type on which I appreciate. It is backlit and looks great. The touchpad is another standout feature with haptic feedback and gesture controls that all work wonderfully and add more depth to the overall experience. The Surface Laptop Studio is a phenomenal device, it is fast, smooth, quiet and a creator^s dream. Windows 11 is the perfect new companion to this laptop with gesture controls built in, designed for touch and stylus controls, and snappy interactivity. I have nothing but praise for Microsoft on the quality and function this computer offers, with power to spare for demanding apps and games, all in a compelling, beautiful package.

Unlike the Lenovo Yoga-flip-style where the screen folds behind the back of the laptop, the Surface Laptop Studio doesn^t flip over. Instead, it uses strong magnets to position the screen in one of three places. There^s standard laptop mode, of course. By gently grasping the top corners of the screen and twisting, the magnets release, the case behind the screen folds, and you can move the screen to the easel mode, where more magnets take over. In easel mode, the keyboard is hidden, but the trackpad remains visible. This is a great configuration for watching movies or for using the touchscreen for web browsing, but it may still feel a bit wobbly for drawing. Lifting the screen again allows you to lay it flat over the bottom case, against the third set of magnets. This is the most stable mode for drawing, which I^ll get to in a bit.The case feels solidly built, and the aluminum has an excellent, high quality matte finish. But, it^s thick and weighs a full four pounds, making it difficult to hold as a tablet and a bit cumbersome for travel. The touchscreen is appropriately sensitive and easy to use. My touchscreen did stop responding once, but it was impossible to tell if this was a hardware issue or a Windows 11 glitch. A reboot fixed the problem.Available in multiple configurations, my unit is equipped with a 512GB SSD, 16GB of RAM, a 3.3 GHz quad-core Intel I7 processor, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card. It^s important to spec this out as you think you^ll want it in the future, as there is no way for the consumer to replace parts. As you might expect, this configuration allows for great multi-tasking, seamless video, and, although I^m not a gamer, appears to be able to keep up with most gaming applications. While it doesn^t run hot, it does get warm enough to keep your legs and fingers toasty. It is also surprisingly quiet, almost completely silent.The Surface Studio comes with a 102W power supply that attaches magnetically to the charging port. This provides fast charging and safety ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ if someone should trip over the power cord, it simply comes out without taking your $2,000 laptop crashing down with it. The charger has a USB-A charging connector on it, which is handy but would be more useful on the laptop itself so that a peripheral could be attached. Two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C connections and an audio connector round out the available ports. The Thunderbolt ports can be used to charge the laptop (more slowly than the mag charger), so you don^t have to travel with the extra power brick if you don^t want to. While a USB-A port would be nice, a micro-SD slot would be even better. Battery life is great for a machine this powerful and with this large a screen. I easily get 10 hours of battery life.The Surface Studio has a great keyboard and trackpad. Tactile feel on the keys is just right, with enough travel and resistance to feel like a real keyboard. The glass trackpad is the best trackpad I^ve ever used, responsive with a smooth glide.The 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ screen is simply amazing. Rich colors, deep blacks, and the 120Hz refresh rate renders the fastest motion without any stuttering. There is one odd design choice on the screen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the corners are rounded instead of square, and you can move your cursor into these recesses and see that they^re used, just not shown. While it gives it a bit softer, less industrial appearance, it might drive you nuts when you realize you^re missing a few pixels of the image in each corner.With four speakers under the unit, the sound is remarkable. Clear, crisp, and with excellent separation, it^s a lot of sound from a small box. There^s no deep bass, nor could there be in such a small form factor, but otherwise it is way beyond other laptops I^ve tried. Microsoft does boast Dolby ATMOS support, although, as with other ATMOS systems where all the speakers are in front of me, I cannot hear the effect; some sounds seem farther away than others, but they always stay in front of me.Tucked into the upper bezel, the HD camera is outstanding for a laptop camera. In a well-lit setting you could use it for video calls without worrying about clarity or color. The microphone produces clear sound.The Slim Pen 2 is a great addition to the Surface Studio. It attaches underneath the keyboard using a strong magnet, and charges while in this position. While not perfect, when the Studio is in tablet mode, the feel of the Pen on screen is closer to pen on paper than my iPad or previous laptops I^ve owned. Tactile feedback is great. I use a larger barreled pen when I write on paper, and I do wish the pen were a bit thicker.Versatile, fast, and possessing excellent daily use ergonomics, this is an amazing laptop for anyone who needs a powerful workstation to go.

Clocking in at just over four pounds with (what I am guessing is) a magnesium alloy case, there is no flex in the case and it feels solid, as it should at this price point. The bottom of the case is a bit weird; it reminds me of a lunch tray in design ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ there^s a jut out that hangs indented from the top of the case with fan grilles on both sides of the laptop to provide for tons of ventilation. I don^t see a single screw hole across the device which some might like, but I^m concerned how much might need to be torn apart to clean out the dust it will inevitably acquire.For ports, you get two USB C ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack and the charging port that has been a hallmark of the Surface lineup for years. Many wish Microsoft dropped it in favor of more USB C ports and a matching charger, but this port has something that USB C does not ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it^s magnetic. As someone with a dog who has tripped over my other barrel jack-ed laptops, I^m going to value this magnetic ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂcan^t break from dog tripsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ charging port far more. Speaking of which, battery life seems solid ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in the five days since acquiring it, I^ve only had to charge it one and a half times from my normal usage.The keyboard is backlit with four different levels and sits nicely above what feels like a glass touchpad with haptic feedback. Typing on the keyboard is about as you^d expect. It doesn^t flex with hard keypresses and it seems to have a nice enough travel for a laptop keyboard. To my untrained eye, the screen is vivid and bright with a large range for backlighting (from ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂI can barely see itÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂblinded by the lightÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ). It has a variable refresh rate along with both an NVIDIA 3050 TI and integrated Intel Iris graphics which Windows will automatically pick between to help drive better battery life. This is not sold as a gaming machine, but I^ve been more than impressed with every game that I^ve played on my Surface. I^m looking forward to growing my library again now that I have a ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂmodern^ graphics card.The laptop switches between passive and active cooling as performance requires. The fans are more than capable for the job and do get loud when they ramp to 100%. Even the fans sound premium; many business-grade laptops have diminutive fans that almost literally scream when they^re going anything above half-speed. This fan makes for some excellent white noise comparatively speaking.All the above makes for a higher-grade laptop that should have very good to excellent statistics for most benchmarks and daily usage. But you^re not reading this review for those readily apparent values. You^re reading this review to figure out if the trick features of the Studio are worth it. Starting with the screen (again) ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ there are three positions. What I^ll call ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlaptop^, ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂeasel^, and ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂtablet^ mode. Opening the lid from closed yields the laptop mode, the opening feels solid and there^s no flex in the back of the screen where the hinge lies. To open the easel mode, press with your thumbs on the top side edges of the screen back towards the table. The second you overcome the magnetic force at the bottom of the screen, the OS falls into touch mode, ready to go. You then move the display to the edge of the keyboard where some magnets hold it nicely in place. When in easel made, you can write or draw as you see fit. In practice, I didn^t find this mode to be terribly comfortable in any regard. The way the display is oriented leaves you constantly trying to find a place to hold your wrist or moving the laptop around to find a comfortable position. Trying to place your wrist on the edge of the laptop base doesn^t really work as the only rounded edge on the laptop are those that round off the display and every other edge on the laptop is basically a 90-degree cutoff. Following up with the full tablet mode, I found this to be a welcome set-up. The Studio has a gyroscope in it to automatically rotate the screen as you rotate the device. This is just as responsive as modern consumers expect. It is a bit heavy to hold in a hand, but I could see it fitting very nicely for taking notes in a class. The display does have a bit of a flex as you write towards the middle of it, but in my testing, I never saw any stress marks forming on the screen as a result of this flex. It does have a similar issue as the easel mode though ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ there are no smooth edges to rest your wrists on and this makes doing things like handwriting recognition difficult. I would probably only use this orientation to take truly handwritten notes in a pen application like OneNote.Moving on to the pen, Microsoft has iterated again on the classic stylus design. The slim pen feels much like a clay stylus with its flat edges. It is very comfortable to hold and write with. The back of the pen acts as an eraser for your writing, allowing for a quick flip when you make a mistake. There is also a right click button right when your thumb would normally rest. In practice, I found it to work well for drawn things, be it hand-written notes or drawings. Microsoft has also ditched the AAAA battery of previous generations in favor of a rechargeable battery that can get its charge from hiding under the middle front of the laptop. It^s magnetized like much of this laptop and the magnet is strong enough that I would expect it to hang on while in a backpack.The pen falls short for handwriting recognition in Windows; this seems to be more a shortcoming of the OS (and always has been to my knowledge) versus issues with the pen. Most of the paragraphs above about the pen were written using written recognition, and it was possibly the most infuriating part of the review. Where other interfaces let you write wherever, Windows restricts you to a limited one-line screen that it processes sequentially with inconsistent rules as to how to edit recognized text. Sometimes a line through a word will eliminate it and other times it will insert a dash.One thing about the pen that I don^t care for ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ despite its $100+ price tag, it feels cheap. Shaking/tapping the pen while you^re thinking or dropping it an inch to your work surface causes it to rattle like a cheap Bic pen. This appears to be part of the design; the stylus tip is a tad bit loose to allow for (what I^d guess is) pressure sensitivity. Apple offers their Pencil 2 product with similar pressure sensitivity, but that pen doesn^t rattle, nor does it have the floating tip. It also doesn^t allow the back to be used like an eraser and the Surface Slim Pen 2 does, so I^m torn on which is better.You may have noticed that the first paragraph said the laptop comes with Windows 11 Home. For the most part, it feels much like Windows 10 with quite a few much-needed quality-of-life enhancements. Windows 10 saw a migration from the Control Panel to the Settings app. Windows 11 makes the Settings app _feel_ like a unified place to manage the operating system. Other notable changes include a centered taskbar and a redesigned Start menu. The taskbar can be moved to the left for those of you who prefer the way it has always been. As a positive change from Windows 10, it doesn^t come with a ton of pre-installed applications; just a few image editing applications that you can remove with a simple right click. For those power users, Microsoft has included Windows Terminal out of the box which is fantastic. I^ve not had a problem with any application I^ve thrown at it yet.I am somewhat disappointed that their premium device didn^t come with Windows 11 Professional. For most home users and even many professional users, you won^t notice the difference. One of the things that the professional edition provides that the home edition does not is access to Hyper-V virtualization manager. Alternatives exist for sure, and you can upgrade to Pro edition using the Microsoft store for an additional $100, but for the price tag that this laptop commands, the last thing I want to do is spend more getting all the features.I found the Laptop Studio to be great in more ways than one, but there were some things that I thought were missing in this package. For one thing, it would have been nice to see a fingerprint reader somewhere on the computer. Windows Hello works great with it, and it makes getting into applications a breeze. Windows 11 is also fresh out of the gate and not everything works perfectly. For instance, while I was writing the paragraph about the pen, I had the pen dialog crash out on me three times.I also lament the loss of ports in favor of a dongle culture. You need special adapters for almost everything - things like USB A, external monitor support, memory card readers, even Ethernet. To my knowledge, the Surface has never had some of these in the series entire lifecycle but having to get an adapter to plug in my old USB devices is upsetting.Overall, I think Microsoft listened to a lot of what their consumers wanted in a laptop and attempted their best to deliver it.

10773,10773,1891,Microsoft - Surface Laptop Studio ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Touch Screen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Intel Core i7 -16GB Memory ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 512GB SSD - Platinum,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/A1Y_00001,FoldAction,Person,Universal,TabletFunction,"I^ve been loving the Surface Pro^s since version 2 and 4, having skipped the rest simply because the detachable keyboards aren^t great to write on for long periods of time, and eventually they get iffy and require a replacement after taking it off and on depending on the situation. No need to worry about that now ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ since it^s permanently attached. It^s quite a step up from all the 2 and 4 that I have ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ you still have the kick stand ability for angled viewing/typing(touchscreen) and the ability to fold it down into tablet mode, without having to take off the keyboard. I^m saying this twice because that is a big deal and the Surface Laptop Studio does it well.Obviously it^s a bit heavier than any of the previous Surface Pros, but no heavier than a regular laptop ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it feels deceptively heavier though ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ at least with my hands ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ because the bottom of the laptop has a lip around all corners. Having the bottom not flush makes it awkward to lift it up with *my* hands. I had a friend pick it up to see if he would notice, and he did not, and I realized it^s going to depend on the hands. The lip in the front is extremely useful though, as it is magnetized and both a holder and charger from the Slim Pen 2. Speaking of the Slim Pen 2, I would recommend getting it (and really, if you^re getting this why wouldn^t you).

I expect random things like this to occur with a new OS.The front facing built in 1080p camera is fine, but my biggest problem with it is the lack of a built in privacy cover. Come on, it^s not expensive to add one ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ HP has a lot of their laptop models with it, and all laptops (and phones) should come with a way to cover the lens (though better to disable). A stick-on webcam cover works wonders though ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ I bought quite a few as I stick them on any devices that do not have one. I^m sure keeping it open allows people to use unlock Windows with their faces, but having a slider on doesn^t prevent it from working and most consumers would be smart enough to know if it doesn^t work or it^s black ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ to slide it open. It^s a little insulting to just assume having one will cause more issues with people not understanding that the webcam is in a blocked mode.Another annoying problem is the power button ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it is dangerously located right next to the Del/Ins button on the upper right. This creates two problems ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the first being that you can easily press the key trying to just press delete! The bigger one is it require the laptop to be in laptop mode with access to the keyboard to press it. In other words, you cannot turn on the computer when it^s in tablet mode, as the screen covers the button.Besides the power button being poorly located on the keyboard, the keyboard is fantastic ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ as is the touchpad. Keyboards are very important ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ the better the feel and spacing, the longer you^re able to use it without accidentally mistyping or moving the mouse around because your wrist brushed the touchpad. My previous laptop had a great keyboard, but the touchpad was too close causing my cursor to randomly jump. The speakers are surprisingly and delightfully loud! I immediately always raise the volume as most laptops max loudness is not very loud at all, and when I played a youtube video ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ it was so loud I had to immediate lower it. Finally, not that this is directly competing with an Ipad, but it *is* competing for me and almost an ipad killer.

10923,10923,1896,Microsoft - Surface Laptop Studio ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Touch Screen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Intel Core i7 -16GB Memory ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 512GB SSD - Platinum,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/A1Y_00001,TypeAction,Person,Universal,Keyboard,"Having had experience with Microsoft Surface tablets in the past I didn""t have high hopes for the new Surface Laptop Studio - boy was I wrong.To begin with, the Studio comes packaged in a solid almost wood-like box, presented like the gem it is. I struggle with this however. While it""s nice to know that a company wants to make it""s product seem as worthy as the packaging (the Studio definitely is), at the end of the day most of the packaging just ends up in the trash. The Studio^s build quality is excellent. The backlit keyboard is a joy to type on, one of the best laptop keyboards i^ve used. The trackpad is on par with my Macbook Pro, it is very responsive and the new haptic feedback is on point. Unlike ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂdiving boardÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ trackpads, you can click anywhere on this one and it knows if you click in the lower right side, it""s a right button click. Very nice.The 14.4 inch touch screen display is a thing of beauty. 120 hertz paired with the Geforce discrete graphics provides buttery smooth scrolling and excellent game play. OLED would have been nice though. Another thing with the display is the corners are now rounded which cut off the corners of windows but not a big deal as most times this only affects the title bar. The hinge on the display feels solid and the magnets that hold it in the two positions are strong. I did notice some flexing on the screen when using the pen in studio mode however. The Slim Pen works better than any of the devices I""ve used in the past and it doesn^t require any hard to find special batteries. It charges under the front lip and is held on by strong magnets. Writing is smooth due to the 120 hertz refresh and the tip is pressure sensitive. The only downside is it is a separate purchase. The I7 chip, 16GB ram and 512GB SSD make the laptop snappy and enough to handle most anything you throw at it. A major disappointment is that Microsoft claims there are no user serviceable parts inside so make your first shot your best as you can not upgrade further.The webcam is 1080 and looks fantastic and the built in microphones sound great, no trouble at all for zoom or team meetings. The Studio has four speakers that sound impressive. They do not have all the base you might want but there is plenty of volume. Battery life is fantastic for a device with this much power, it easily provides a full work day and more. The laptop comes with Microsoft^s charger which is magnetic so if it gets caught on something or your pet walking through it, it will just pop out without pulling your new laptop to the ground. There is also a charging light on the charger but it""s on the outside making it difficult to see. I would have preferred it to be on the top or bottom of the plug to be more visible. The Studio will also charge via the USB C ports.The base has a two-tier design which I really like. It does make the unit a little thicker than it initially appears but the heat vents blow out the sides rather than bottom so using this in your lap does not block the vents causing it to overheat. Regarding heat, I didn^t notice any loud cooling fan noise at all.

I struggle with this however. While it""s nice to know that a company wants to make it""s product seem as worthy as the packaging (the Studio definitely is), at the end of the day most of the packaging just ends up in the trash. The Studio^s build quality is excellent. The backlit keyboard is a joy to type on, one of the best laptop keyboards i^ve used. The trackpad is on par with my Macbook Pro, it is very responsive and the new haptic feedback is on point. Unlike ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂdiving boardÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ trackpads, you can click anywhere on this one and it knows if you click in the lower right side, it""s a right button click. Very nice.The 14.4 inch touch screen display is a thing of beauty. 120 hertz paired with the Geforce discrete graphics provides buttery smooth scrolling and excellent game play. OLED would have been nice though. Another thing with the display is the corners are now rounded which cut off the corners of windows but not a big deal as most times this only affects the title bar. The hinge on the display feels solid and the magnets that hold it in the two positions are strong. I did notice some flexing on the screen when using the pen in studio mode however. The Slim Pen works better than any of the devices I""ve used in the past and it doesn^t require any hard to find special batteries. It charges under the front lip and is held on by strong magnets. Writing is smooth due to the 120 hertz refresh and the tip is pressure sensitive. The only downside is it is a separate purchase. The I7 chip, 16GB ram and 512GB SSD make the laptop snappy and enough to handle most anything you throw at it. A major disappointment is that Microsoft claims there are no user serviceable parts inside so make your first shot your best as you can not upgrade further.The webcam is 1080 and looks fantastic and the built in microphones sound great, no trouble at all for zoom or team meetings. The Studio has four speakers that sound impressive. They do not have all the base you might want but there is plenty of volume. Battery life is fantastic for a device with this much power, it easily provides a full work day and more. The laptop comes with Microsoft^s charger which is magnetic so if it gets caught on something or your pet walking through it, it will just pop out without pulling your new laptop to the ground. There is also a charging light on the charger but it""s on the outside making it difficult to see. I would have preferred it to be on the top or bottom of the plug to be more visible. The Studio will also charge via the USB C ports.The base has a two-tier design which I really like. It does make the unit a little thicker than it initially appears but the heat vents blow out the sides rather than bottom so using this in your lap does not block the vents causing it to overheat.

But there^s nothing standard or regular about it. This innovative hybrid combines the best features of MS^ Surface Pro & Surface Laptop in the form of an all-new Surface Laptop Studio. Unlike previous model tablets, the display on this Studio laptop isn^t detachable. Instead, you can pull the display forward to create a near-perfect viewing angle in an easel-like ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂkickstandÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ position (just in front of the keyboard) or lay it down, completely flat, over the keyboard like a tablet. To better visualize a progression of the 3 primary modes (ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlaptop,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstage,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ & ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstudioÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ) via the fully adjustable screen: You can use the device as your primary workhorse laptop w/all the Apps/programs, speed, & quad-core computing power needed for a heavy workload. But in an instant, you can effortlessly transform it from a laptop, to a video-viewing entertainment ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstage,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ e-reader, or gaming device, & then finally transition to a drawing/sketching canvas or ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂstudioÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ tablet & more. It^s astonishing just how easily it morphs from 1 configuration to another. Talk about multitasking! So, the question isn^t what can you do w/this versatile all-in-1 device; rather, it^s what CAN^T you do w/it? Warning: If you^re a little ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂADD,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ you^ll have to work to stay focused to control your impulses. Otherwise, you can easily find yourself jumping back & forth between work & play options. Without some self-imposed discipline, this multifaceted productivity tool can lure you away from accomplishing your daily objectives & priorities & result in your veering off-track to go exploring.Although there^s much to highlight, I^ll name just a few of the features that really stand out to us:- Setup is a breeze. It came fully charged; so, there was no delay in diving in. The moment you open the lid, you^re guided through an easy setup process. Even a Luddite should have no fear here. All you need is your Wi-Fi PW & Microsoft Acct. creds to log in (or you can create a new MS acct.). The device immediately performs an update & offers a tour.- Form Factor: Everything about this hybrid device feels high-end. Aesthetically, its magnesium alloy & aluminum case is sleek, compact & beautiful. Much of the beauty stems from the ingenious design of MS^ Dynamic Woven Hinge, an engineering marvel, which allows you to convert this multi-mode laptop-tablet on the fly. By comparison, we had tried 3 different cases for our old tablet in search of the right keyboard/kickstand combo for makeshift typing & viewing. Thankfully, those days are over! Of course, if you^re used to a limited, 2-lb., tablet-only device, this 4-lb. laptop-tablet hybrid may take a little getting used to. But for us, the increase in flexibility/versatility is well worth the adjustment.- Software Suite: It^s preloaded w/all the MS Office programs. We use MS 365 at work & home, so this was a must.- Display: The 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ PixelSense Flow touchscreen (w/3:2 aspect ratio & Dolby Vision) offers 2400 x 1600-pixel resolution, along w/bright, impressive graphic details from the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU & nice, smooth motion video from the 120Hz screen refresh rate.- The Backlit Keyboard offers a good feel w/proper travel & key spacing, & the large customizable haptic touchpad is state-of-the-art, w/the most precise response to clicks/gestures over the ENTIRE touchpad we^ve ever experienced.- The Slim Pen 2 has a new haptic motor that provides tactile feedback for a feeling of greater precision & control. Using the pen, we took cursive & printed notes in our handwriting, drew & sketched, & navigated the touchscreen. The pen produces associated vibrations for certain gestures & editing features such as highlighting & erasing, etc. Given that my wife has long been a Samsung Galaxy Note user, she^s become quite proficient w/its S-Pen. So, she took to the Slim Pen 2 faster than I did & showed me some helpful tips. Hopefully sooner than later, there will be more apps available that allow users to utilize this pen^s new haptic features. And although the simulated feel is still not all the way there, we both agree that this new pen comes closer to replicating the feel of taking pen to paper than any other digital pen we^ve tried. In addition, we also like the clean, minimalist way that the pen is stored. We^ve previously lost styluses & digital pens because we didn^t store them in their holder. Now, we just tuck the pen horizontally under the laptop^s front edge, where it magnetically snaps into place. This keeps the pen hidden yet readily accessible, where it wirelessly charges while attached & remains ready for use.- The Quad Omnisonic speakers produce a good sound quality given the severe size & weight restrictions of the slim laptop/tablet environs. We tested the audio output by streaming 4 of our favorite oldies but goodies, including Coldplay^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂClocks,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ God Is an Astronaut^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂSuicide by Star,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Hybrid^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂDisappear Here,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ & The Cinematic Orchestra^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂArrival of the Birds.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Although we went into the test w/zero expectations for anything remotely satisfying from the speakers of a light laptop, we both grinned during the initial playback of the 1st few bars of our sampled pieces. While the speakers won^t make an audiophile smile, they do produce a better sound than any of the other small/thin laptops & tablets we^ve used. No, the subwoofers don^t produce a punchy bass, but the 4 speakers still offer clear, fairly balanced audio w/relatively little distortion, even at higher volumes, as the adaptive equalization technology impressively adjusts the output as we adjust the volume. And the side-firing vents for the 2 main speakers give them a little bit of a spatial feel. There^s also a 3.5mm audio jack located on the upper right side, just below the Surface Connect charging port, & 2 far-field mics.- CPU Performance is top-notch! Thanks to the 11th-gen Intel Tiger Lake H35 quad-core i7-11370H processors, even w/several programs/tabs open, we can watch videos w/o any performance degradation. During gaming, when the fan kicks in, I was pleased to find that the laptop didn^t become overly warm as my other small laptops have in the past.- The Lithium-Ion Battery is rated at up to 18 hrs./charge, depending on usage. While we haven^t done a lot of gaming over the 1st few days, we did engage in some moderate-to-heavy laptop work, including multitasking w/multiple apps & tabs open as well as some video playback. And we had enough juice to continue uninterrupted over an 8-to-12-hr. day. But starting w/a full charge, if we were unplugged while gaming, we experienced dramatically less battery life than we^d hoped for at a disappointingly low 5 hrs.- I do wish MS had included more ports.

It^s astonishing just how easily it morphs from 1 configuration to another. Talk about multitasking! So, the question isn^t what can you do w/this versatile all-in-1 device; rather, it^s what CAN^T you do w/it? Warning: If you^re a little ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂADD,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ you^ll have to work to stay focused to control your impulses. Otherwise, you can easily find yourself jumping back & forth between work & play options. Without some self-imposed discipline, this multifaceted productivity tool can lure you away from accomplishing your daily objectives & priorities & result in your veering off-track to go exploring.Although there^s much to highlight, I^ll name just a few of the features that really stand out to us:- Setup is a breeze. It came fully charged; so, there was no delay in diving in. The moment you open the lid, you^re guided through an easy setup process. Even a Luddite should have no fear here. All you need is your Wi-Fi PW & Microsoft Acct. creds to log in (or you can create a new MS acct.). The device immediately performs an update & offers a tour.- Form Factor: Everything about this hybrid device feels high-end. Aesthetically, its magnesium alloy & aluminum case is sleek, compact & beautiful. Much of the beauty stems from the ingenious design of MS^ Dynamic Woven Hinge, an engineering marvel, which allows you to convert this multi-mode laptop-tablet on the fly. By comparison, we had tried 3 different cases for our old tablet in search of the right keyboard/kickstand combo for makeshift typing & viewing. Thankfully, those days are over! Of course, if you^re used to a limited, 2-lb., tablet-only device, this 4-lb. laptop-tablet hybrid may take a little getting used to. But for us, the increase in flexibility/versatility is well worth the adjustment.- Software Suite: It^s preloaded w/all the MS Office programs. We use MS 365 at work & home, so this was a must.- Display: The 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ PixelSense Flow touchscreen (w/3:2 aspect ratio & Dolby Vision) offers 2400 x 1600-pixel resolution, along w/bright, impressive graphic details from the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU & nice, smooth motion video from the 120Hz screen refresh rate.- The Backlit Keyboard offers a good feel w/proper travel & key spacing, & the large customizable haptic touchpad is state-of-the-art, w/the most precise response to clicks/gestures over the ENTIRE touchpad we^ve ever experienced.- The Slim Pen 2 has a new haptic motor that provides tactile feedback for a feeling of greater precision & control. Using the pen, we took cursive & printed notes in our handwriting, drew & sketched, & navigated the touchscreen. The pen produces associated vibrations for certain gestures & editing features such as highlighting & erasing, etc. Given that my wife has long been a Samsung Galaxy Note user, she^s become quite proficient w/its S-Pen. So, she took to the Slim Pen 2 faster than I did & showed me some helpful tips. Hopefully sooner than later, there will be more apps available that allow users to utilize this pen^s new haptic features. And although the simulated feel is still not all the way there, we both agree that this new pen comes closer to replicating the feel of taking pen to paper than any other digital pen we^ve tried. In addition, we also like the clean, minimalist way that the pen is stored. We^ve previously lost styluses & digital pens because we didn^t store them in their holder. Now, we just tuck the pen horizontally under the laptop^s front edge, where it magnetically snaps into place. This keeps the pen hidden yet readily accessible, where it wirelessly charges while attached & remains ready for use.- The Quad Omnisonic speakers produce a good sound quality given the severe size & weight restrictions of the slim laptop/tablet environs. We tested the audio output by streaming 4 of our favorite oldies but goodies, including Coldplay^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂClocks,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ God Is an Astronaut^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂSuicide by Star,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Hybrid^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂDisappear Here,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ & The Cinematic Orchestra^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂArrival of the Birds.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Although we went into the test w/zero expectations for anything remotely satisfying from the speakers of a light laptop, we both grinned during the initial playback of the 1st few bars of our sampled pieces. While the speakers won^t make an audiophile smile, they do produce a better sound than any of the other small/thin laptops & tablets we^ve used. No, the subwoofers don^t produce a punchy bass, but the 4 speakers still offer clear, fairly balanced audio w/relatively little distortion, even at higher volumes, as the adaptive equalization technology impressively adjusts the output as we adjust the volume. And the side-firing vents for the 2 main speakers give them a little bit of a spatial feel. There^s also a 3.5mm audio jack located on the upper right side, just below the Surface Connect charging port, & 2 far-field mics.- CPU Performance is top-notch! Thanks to the 11th-gen Intel Tiger Lake H35 quad-core i7-11370H processors, even w/several programs/tabs open, we can watch videos w/o any performance degradation. During gaming, when the fan kicks in, I was pleased to find that the laptop didn^t become overly warm as my other small laptops have in the past.- The Lithium-Ion Battery is rated at up to 18 hrs./charge, depending on usage. While we haven^t done a lot of gaming over the 1st few days, we did engage in some moderate-to-heavy laptop work, including multitasking w/multiple apps & tabs open as well as some video playback.

We use MS 365 at work & home, so this was a must.- Display: The 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ PixelSense Flow touchscreen (w/3:2 aspect ratio & Dolby Vision) offers 2400 x 1600-pixel resolution, along w/bright, impressive graphic details from the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU & nice, smooth motion video from the 120Hz screen refresh rate.- The Backlit Keyboard offers a good feel w/proper travel & key spacing, & the large customizable haptic touchpad is state-of-the-art, w/the most precise response to clicks/gestures over the ENTIRE touchpad we^ve ever experienced.- The Slim Pen 2 has a new haptic motor that provides tactile feedback for a feeling of greater precision & control. Using the pen, we took cursive & printed notes in our handwriting, drew & sketched, & navigated the touchscreen. The pen produces associated vibrations for certain gestures & editing features such as highlighting & erasing, etc. Given that my wife has long been a Samsung Galaxy Note user, she^s become quite proficient w/its S-Pen. So, she took to the Slim Pen 2 faster than I did & showed me some helpful tips. Hopefully sooner than later, there will be more apps available that allow users to utilize this pen^s new haptic features. And although the simulated feel is still not all the way there, we both agree that this new pen comes closer to replicating the feel of taking pen to paper than any other digital pen we^ve tried. In addition, we also like the clean, minimalist way that the pen is stored. We^ve previously lost styluses & digital pens because we didn^t store them in their holder. Now, we just tuck the pen horizontally under the laptop^s front edge, where it magnetically snaps into place. This keeps the pen hidden yet readily accessible, where it wirelessly charges while attached & remains ready for use.- The Quad Omnisonic speakers produce a good sound quality given the severe size & weight restrictions of the slim laptop/tablet environs. We tested the audio output by streaming 4 of our favorite oldies but goodies, including Coldplay^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂClocks,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ God Is an Astronaut^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂSuicide by Star,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Hybrid^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂDisappear Here,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ & The Cinematic Orchestra^s ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂArrival of the Birds.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Although we went into the test w/zero expectations for anything remotely satisfying from the speakers of a light laptop, we both grinned during the initial playback of the 1st few bars of our sampled pieces. While the speakers won^t make an audiophile smile, they do produce a better sound than any of the other small/thin laptops & tablets we^ve used. No, the subwoofers don^t produce a punchy bass, but the 4 speakers still offer clear, fairly balanced audio w/relatively little distortion, even at higher volumes, as the adaptive equalization technology impressively adjusts the output as we adjust the volume. And the side-firing vents for the 2 main speakers give them a little bit of a spatial feel. There^s also a 3.5mm audio jack located on the upper right side, just below the Surface Connect charging port, & 2 far-field mics.- CPU Performance is top-notch! Thanks to the 11th-gen Intel Tiger Lake H35 quad-core i7-11370H processors, even w/several programs/tabs open, we can watch videos w/o any performance degradation. During gaming, when the fan kicks in, I was pleased to find that the laptop didn^t become overly warm as my other small laptops have in the past.- The Lithium-Ion Battery is rated at up to 18 hrs./charge, depending on usage. While we haven^t done a lot of gaming over the 1st few days, we did engage in some moderate-to-heavy laptop work, including multitasking w/multiple apps & tabs open as well as some video playback. And we had enough juice to continue uninterrupted over an 8-to-12-hr. day. But starting w/a full charge, if we were unplugged while gaming, we experienced dramatically less battery life than we^d hoped for at a disappointingly low 5 hrs.- I do wish MS had included more ports. With just 2 USB 4.0 ports [w/Thunderbolt 4 (40Gbps) support], & no full-size USB-A port, the options for additional peripherals are too limited.",5,positive,"The user likes that during gaming, the product doesn""t get warm ","During gaming, when the fan kicks in, I was pleased to find that the laptop didn^t become overly warm as my other small laptops have in the past",http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/ba3c1882ca1fc039130ebaf6c43368b2,2021-12-04T05:37:04,"During gaming, when the fan kicks in, I was pleased to find that the laptop didn^t become overly warm as my other small laptops have in the past.- The Lithium-Ion Battery is rated at up to 18 hrs./charge, depending on usage.",PlayAction,Action Exist

Maybe you are a student who likes to decompress by sketching or you have dreams of drawing or designing. Maybe you are a notetaker? This model is actually the sweet spot in the lineup for value and performance. It can provide a tablet/legal pad writing experience like no other by just using a magnetic slim pen. I love the versatility, adaptability, and portability in my daily workflow and all without compromising too much. Had a long day? This can be your media consumption device as well. You can get by with a gaming session on most games using high settings and get respectable to decent fps. This isn""t a gaming laptop, but it can be one in a pinch. This is directly tied to its weakness as a gaming laptop. That is where the Achilles Heel, with all this greatness, comes into the picture. Maybe it was done to preserve another product line, but choices are always good for clients, especially in the GPU department. The overall value proposition is excellent, and the versatility is unmatched for a device like this - a laptop. The screen is a 14.4"" 120hz IPS Pixel Sense display panel with a 3:2 aspect ratio of 201ppi, 500 nits of brightness, and Dolby Vision capable.

You don""t get much regarding I/O with only 4 ports on the machine - 2 Thunderbolt 4, 1 3.5mm headphone, and Surface Connect port. The keyboard is backlit and offers an excellent typing experience Surface keyboards are known for a nice big touchpad with haptic feedback. WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 to go with a 1080p 2MP AI-powered webcam with Windows Hello IR. For me, there is a HUGE compromise that you must accept by making this purchase - that is, the GPU selection (or lack thereof) and the ultimate choice of the RTX 3050ti for the build. I am sure there were reasons this was chosen - potentially involving the chip shortage - but the very least many would expect as a ""budget"" GPU for creatives would be an RTX 3060ti. The RTX 3060ti is beefier in performance, and you would also be able to pitch this as a gaming-capable PC. The true DO IT ALL device. For video, the lowest compromise I would make is a 3060ti if it was me at design HQ. The performance increase is immense vs. the 3050ti, and I will leave it at that. Otherwise, this is a PERFECT machine for the traveling creative or professional. If you use a laptop, this is for you. If you use a tablet, this could be for you. If you use a tablet to sketch or design things, this can be for you. Students and corporate executives, this is for you too! This is so versatile, it could cannibalize other parts of the laptop/PC/tablet market in a few years with proper development and vision. I like what I see here and look forward to developing this new hinge and other upgrades to this new device. Thoughts for Improvement-Volume buttons - When I use this in any mode other than laptop mode, I find myself searching for and wishing there were buttons for volume on the right or left side of the screen. It is a pain to swipe up in the taskbar to adjust the volume with the icon or in-app volume controls. I look for a tablet experience blended here as well for the perfect blending of the surface lineup. Tactile volume buttons would be a plus.-GPU choices - 3050ti is not the best choice if this is geared towards creatives. The minimum we should see is a 3060 for machines geared towards creatives. There are no options to pay for more powerful cards like the 3060/70/80, which is my biggest complaint. The card is just OK, more than enough for an everyday user, but power users are looking for at least the 3060 as their budget options. While this is fantastic for art and just decent at gaming, this is a well-rounded machine weakened by the graphics department.-Pixels missing - This is a nit-pick, but the corners are rounded on display, and you lose pixels of a square screen. Parts of the mouse cursor disappear, and the rounded corner is not taken into account. This could be a problem for creators and editors who look at every pixel at the edges of the display. Most will not be bothered or even notice this at all, I am sure.- Upgradability w/ access door - This isn""t very consumer repair friendly after supporting it. The backplate is thin and surrounded by lots of sticky tape, but if you are skilled and can watch a video, you can do it yourself. With a platform base, I would expect the EASIEST way to upgrade this machine is to make an access door/s. You will need to be highly skilled and think it through before attempting, or you will break the bottom plate. This is a Microsoft ""job"" most shouldn""t try.-Poor I/O #donglelife - I/O selection is poor and very basic. This means you will be signing up for #donglelife. Another thing I do not like is the fact the ports are on both sides. I would have liked to see everything on the left side to avoid wires on the right where you may be using your mouse.-No SD card reader - no SD Card slot, only 2 USB 4 Thunderbolt USB-Cs, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Surface Connect port, that""s it? Again, this big platform should be filled with I/O since it gives the appearance of a docking station.-Colors - I wish there was a matte black option to match the Slim Pen 2. The fact there isn""t a platinum Slim Pen 2 is not a good look. You have a black pen standing out against a platinum laptop. I thought this was about planning and keeping things ""at the center""? A black pen ""at the center"" of my laptop is an eyesore in my opinion.

Windows 11 home is installed out of the box on a build with i7-11370, RTX 3050ti 4GB DDR6 RAM, 16GB RAM, m.2 SSD with half TB of storage. You don""t get much regarding I/O with only 4 ports on the machine - 2 Thunderbolt 4, 1 3.5mm headphone, and Surface Connect port. The keyboard is backlit and offers an excellent typing experience Surface keyboards are known for a nice big touchpad with haptic feedback. WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 to go with a 1080p 2MP AI-powered webcam with Windows Hello IR. For me, there is a HUGE compromise that you must accept by making this purchase - that is, the GPU selection (or lack thereof) and the ultimate choice of the RTX 3050ti for the build. I am sure there were reasons this was chosen - potentially involving the chip shortage - but the very least many would expect as a ""budget"" GPU for creatives would be an RTX 3060ti. The RTX 3060ti is beefier in performance, and you would also be able to pitch this as a gaming-capable PC. The true DO IT ALL device. For video, the lowest compromise I would make is a 3060ti if it was me at design HQ. The performance increase is immense vs. the 3050ti, and I will leave it at that. Otherwise, this is a PERFECT machine for the traveling creative or professional. If you use a laptop, this is for you. If you use a tablet, this could be for you. If you use a tablet to sketch or design things, this can be for you. Students and corporate executives, this is for you too! This is so versatile, it could cannibalize other parts of the laptop/PC/tablet market in a few years with proper development and vision. I like what I see here and look forward to developing this new hinge and other upgrades to this new device. Thoughts for Improvement-Volume buttons - When I use this in any mode other than laptop mode, I find myself searching for and wishing there were buttons for volume on the right or left side of the screen. It is a pain to swipe up in the taskbar to adjust the volume with the icon or in-app volume controls. I look for a tablet experience blended here as well for the perfect blending of the surface lineup. Tactile volume buttons would be a plus.-GPU choices - 3050ti is not the best choice if this is geared towards creatives. The minimum we should see is a 3060 for machines geared towards creatives. There are no options to pay for more powerful cards like the 3060/70/80, which is my biggest complaint. The card is just OK, more than enough for an everyday user, but power users are looking for at least the 3060 as their budget options. While this is fantastic for art and just decent at gaming, this is a well-rounded machine weakened by the graphics department.-Pixels missing - This is a nit-pick, but the corners are rounded on display, and you lose pixels of a square screen. Parts of the mouse cursor disappear, and the rounded corner is not taken into account. This could be a problem for creators and editors who look at every pixel at the edges of the display. Most will not be bothered or even notice this at all, I am sure.- Upgradability w/ access door - This isn""t very consumer repair friendly after supporting it. The backplate is thin and surrounded by lots of sticky tape, but if you are skilled and can watch a video, you can do it yourself. With a platform base, I would expect the EASIEST way to upgrade this machine is to make an access door/s. You will need to be highly skilled and think it through before attempting, or you will break the bottom plate. This is a Microsoft ""job"" most shouldn""t try.-Poor I/O #donglelife - I/O selection is poor and very basic. This means you will be signing up for #donglelife. Another thing I do not like is the fact the ports are on both sides. I would have liked to see everything on the left side to avoid wires on the right where you may be using your mouse.-No SD card reader - no SD Card slot, only 2 USB 4 Thunderbolt USB-Cs, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Surface Connect port, that""s it? Again, this big platform should be filled with I/O since it gives the appearance of a docking station.-Colors - I wish there was a matte black option to match the Slim Pen 2. The fact there isn""t a platinum Slim Pen 2 is not a good look. You have a black pen standing out against a platinum laptop. I thought this was about planning and keeping things ""at the center""? A black pen ""at the center"" of my laptop is an eyesore in my opinion. A quick and easy fix and probably already in the works.-Matte screen option - I wish there were matte and gloss screen options; indoors, the glossy screen is very reflective and distracting. Outdoors, don""t even try!-Brighter display - I""d like to see up to 1000 nits if we are shooting for creatives. Many get inspiration from the outdoors, and drawing outside on a sunny day is tough sometimes between the reflective display and low brightness.

The Stage mode/Easel mode is great for viewing content. It reminds me of using an iPad in a folio mode. The screen wabbles much less in this mode, if you want to use the touchscreen.My intended use is web browsing, watching content and home use, so I wont really be making use of the flat mode, as I think its intended for creative work. I^ll primarily be relaying on the laptop mode. Also, given the size, I^m not sure if I can use it as a tablet.The display is 120 Hz and 3:2 aspect ratio is great for taller applications and the ability to dock applications in multiple configurations is especially useful. The keyboard is very clicky and nicely spaced out. The overall body is rigid and gives the impression of a Macbook Pro.I love the huge trackpad. The pen simulates the feeling of writing on paper. It doesn^t feel exactly like paper, but it^s a nice touch. I like how the pen snaps into the base via very strong magnets. Its inconspicuous and charges there.The laptop is heavy. That can be attributed I guess to the screen and the double-decker base that has air vents. I haven^t seen any issues with it getting hot. With my regular usage, I doubt it will be put through its paces.The other drawback is limited ports. The laptop only has 2 USB-C ports and a headphone jack.

It sucks to have went from the Surfacebook with almost 8+ hour battery down to this which has maybe 4. It""s 2021.... Hopefully Microsoft can come up with some optimizations for it as Windows 11 gets more polished.-There""s literally only 2 ports. So if you carry this with you anywhere you almost are guaranteed to have to buy some sort of dock or dongle to be able to do anything. It""s stupid literally that you can""t even plug in a USB stick in a hurry or a wireless mouse.-The fan blows on your hands. I like this feature personally but it""s definitely a quirk worth mentioning since I""m sure some would hate that.-Comes with Windows 10 HOME. Period. None of the Best Buy models have Pro even as an option.

I^ve been around several Surface Books owned by friends, relatives and co-workers and I^ve played around with several models. I tried both the fixed and detachable display formats and found I preferred the fixed screen version more. I witnessed too many problems and compromises with the detachable screen models. I have not seen many issues with the fixed displays and have had no problems with this new Surface Studio. It^s a versatile all-around performer suitable for productivity, drawing, graphic design, photo/video editing and even light to moderate gaming. The unique design allows the Studio to be used in the more traditional form factor or in a manner more suitable for creative use, such as like a tablet or the new innovative split screen tent mode. The screen quality is quite good. It has accurate colors, great brightness, and crisp sharp graphics. The high gloss screen can be a glare reflecting nightmare in certain lighting conditions but that^s about my only complaint with the screen. The 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and pen strokes noticeably smooth. The Microsoft Slim Pen 2 works wonderfully with the laptop studio. The pen glides across the screen without any resistance or harsh feel. It provides good pressure variations and sensitivity for drawing. It^s also quite robust at note taking and can effortlessly pull double duty as both a sketch pen and writing instrument. That provides an extra layer of efficiency for art students or those who work in the creative or design industry. Microsoft peripherals pair effortlessly right out of the box. A Microsoft Slim Pen and a Surface Arc mouse paired automatically with the Studio as soon as I powered them on the first time. Performance is solid across the board. Apps run smooth and reliably. Windows 11 has only been out a little over two-weeks, so some obvious growing pains are expected. So far, issues have been minimal. Most of the 2022 versions of apps and subscription services like Adobe are the most compatible and least problem plagued. Older apps and lesser-known specialized apps may be a little more susceptible to issues but so far, compatibility has been surprisingly good. This is even so with my less mainstream art apps. Office 365, Norton AV, Adobe Acrobat Pro and the art and design apps I use all work fine. I encountered slight issues with two apps but that^s about par for the course with a new OS and no fault of the hardware. Making the jump to Windows 11 should weigh heavily into the decision to purchase any new Windows 11 laptop. All prospective purchasers should make sure any must-have apps are compatible with Windows 11, especially if it will be their only laptop. If I""m being honest, there are a few changes in Windows 11 that I""m less than thrilled about. From a raw power standpoint, this machine can easily manage routine drawing, photo editing, desktop productivity and light to moderate gaming. Although the RTX-3050 GPU sounds bleeding-edge, real-world performance is closer to a GTX-1060 6GB than an RTX 2060. Given the versatile nature of this machine, it is more than sufficient for casual gaming and can easily pull moderate gaming demands with decent performance. Forza Horizon 4 and NFS Heat both run quite well on this machine at reasonable settings, with smooth framerates and both look awesome on the 2400x1600 120Hz display. Despite the 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ display, the form factor isn^t the most compact. The brushed aluminum body looks good but is also larger than most other 14ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ machines. It also has a wide bezel, is a bit on the heavy side, and is lacking in ports. Ports are limited to two Thunderbolt compatible USB-C ports. Yep, that^s it, so get your adapters ready. I^m surprised a studio device aimed at creatives doesn^t have at least an SD card port. The chassis design is a bit unusual, yet stylish looking and allows decent all-around cooling. One cool feature is a convenient magnetic cavity for storing and charging the slim pen. It keeps the pen both handy and charged at all times. Due to the weight and design, I personally prefer using the laptop studio on a desktop rather than in my lap like a tablet. Desktop use also makes it easier for me to use a portable dock to provide additional port options. Despite this fact, it^s still good to have portability for resuming work away from home or office. It also has a reasonably sized attachable power supply. The Studio doesn^t tend to run hot under normal load, but it can get noticeably warm when throttled enough. Biometrics include facial recognition but surprisingly, no fingerprint sensor or option. I prefer fingerprint over facial recognition because I^m not a fan of a self-activated camera nor using the camera for login. In fact, I^m one of the people who usually puts tape or a closeable slim shutter over the camera. On the plus side, the facial recognition works reliably, even while wearing hats and glasses. It quickly unlocks the PC as soon as my face nears the screen and has never failed to recognize me. It has also never unlocked for anyone but me. Speaking of the camera, the quality is decent for videoconferencing, as are the speakers and microphone. The backlit keyboard types well and the keys have a nice solid feel. From what I can tell, the multi-gesture trackpad seems okay, but I absolutely loathe trackpads, so I^m not the best source for feedback on that one. I immediately paired a Surface Arc mouse with the Studio right out of the box and have not used the trackpad at all beyond the initial laptop setup.Battery life is about what I expected from a machine with these innards and capability. That would be mediocre. Regular desktop use yields several hours before I must reach for the charger. Heavy processor and/or GPU use for gaming, video encoding or other resource intensive tasks dramatically cut into battery life due to extra processing and cooling requirements. If I^m going to tax the CPU or GPU, I just plug in to AC from the beginning to save myself the aggravation.Overall, I like the Surface Laptop Studio. It^s multi-talented, versatile, all-around performer that can take the place of two or three individual devices. It^s not perfect but things seldom are. There^s always room for improvement, for example it could use more ports, a fingerprint option would be nice, and the weight could be lighter. However, regardless of any perceived shortcomings, I think Microsoft did quite well on this one. I^m enjoying it tremendously and finding it quite useful as an all-in-one device. The versatility does make my hectic life easier and more efficient. I no longer need my Cintiq all the time. I don^t always need my tablet to take notes. I can now do it all on one device.

To begin with, this Surface is the epitome of versatility. It is a great 3 in 1 laptop that allows you to accomplish so much without having to go from one device to another. Previous to getting this Surface, I would go from a traditional laptop to my tablet or my PC to my tablet. Now with this Surface Studio, I am getting rid of my traditional laptop and tablet and just sticking with this Surface Studio. When you are thinking of getting a new device, there are many things to consider. Here are some of the highlights to this Surface Studio for me:Hardware-It has a very rigid magnesium and aluminum casing which makes this device very solid and sturdy. This is very important especially if you are thinking of having to transport this device in a backpack or bag of some kind. It has 2 USB-C ports that are Thunderbolt 4 on one side and on the other it has a headphone jack and the Surface connect port. No SD card reader, but you can always add an SD card reader dongle.Keys on the keyboard are clicky and the keyboard is backlit, even when you engage the trackpad.Speakers are decent, but not great. They are decent because it can produce a pretty strong volume, but the sound quality could be better. You will notice this as you are gaming or watching a movie.It has a nice 120 hertz refresh rate with 2400 x 1600 resolution and the webcam is 1080 p.I am very impressed with the trackpad. It is very responsive and is very intuitive when using it. If you are getting this Surface Studio laptop, then I highly recommend that you also purchase the Surface Slim Pen 2 to make the most of this laptop. It is very easy to write on the screen with the Pen 2 and it allows you to click and drag windows. The pen produces a small vibration that kind of simulates the feeling of writing on paper. You charge the pen under the front lip of the laptop. I like how easily the pen engages the front lip of the laptop because of the strong magnets. You don""t have to worry about the pen falling or sliding off.As I stated earlier, the biggest benefit to this laptop is the versatility it provides. You can use this laptop in 3 modes: Standard laptop, easel set up, or completely folded in a tablet set up. As you do the majority of your work on this machine, you will probably be using the standard laptop mode. This Surface Studio comes with 3X2 aspect ratio which comes in handy with taller apps and multitasking in Windows 11. With the easel position, you pop the bottom of the screen towards you, but it doesn""t cover the trackpad. This mode is ideal for watching movies, videos or playing video games. At this angle the monitor is very steady. This is important to note because this mode is great when you want to use some your apps with the touchscreen.Finally, you have the ability to use this laptop in tablet mode. With this mode you will have full time touchscreen interaction. This laptop is heavier than your average android tablet or Ipad, but at 4 lbs you adjust to the difference. It has been nice to have a 14 inch tablet instead of a 10 inch screen. This mode is also where you would also incorporate the use of the Surface Slim Pen 2 the most. This mode is ideal for those creator focused individuals.Overall, I am highly impressed with this new Surface Studio laptop. There is so much that you can accomplish with this laptop.

The connector for USB and 2nd monitor is well built and solid, but again adds weight. As I usually do not take this thing anywhere, except to the porch, weight is not an issue with me. It is incredibly fast, and the wifi is solid. I have a dead spot at my desk, but it never is slow. Good bluetooth for mouse and pen. Lots of space. If needed, it is easy to connect an external harddrive. Windows 11 is a bit different, but much is recognizable or able to be figured out with a bit of playing around.

We""ve seen the concept improve over the years. I had the first Surface Pro laptop, I can""t say I enjoyed the problems I had with it. But since that experience we""ve had 4 additional models. I""ve tried all of Microsoft""s Surface Pro keyboards - none I""ve used for long. But I have to say it seems like Microsoft has been listening. Almost all of the Laptop problem""s of the past are addressed in this new Surface Laptop Studio (SLS). Their displays have always been one of the best you could find, but the SLS is a step better with 120hz display, with by far the best touchscreen you can buy. I have 4 other ""current"" notebooks (all 15"", Intel 10 or 11 Gen or Ryzen 5), none have a clearer display than this SLS. And then new gen 2 pencil is a nice improvement, it""s shorter, and not round, more of a flattened oval that magnetically attaches and recharges from the front edge of the studio, hidden, but well connected to the notebook. And it""s pressure sensitivity is far more acurate (I didn""t think it would be a worthy upgrade, I was wrong, if you are accustomed to using a stylus, get this pencil). I annotate a lot of drawings, I love this new pencil.This notebook is a new design for MS, it""s thinner that their previous laptops (but about the same 4lbs weight), but it has 3 display modes: Laptop, Tablet and Stage mode. Another company recently had a high end product called a Folio, with a similar screen mechanism (I have one); in fact this type of mechanism has been tried by others for many years, but none have been as thin or as sturdy as this MS implementation. That being said a 4lbs tablet is a bit on the heavy side for me, sure I""ll probably use it on a couch as a tablet occasionally, but I have other tablets that weight closer to on pound, which for me is more comfortable as a tablet over time. But having the flexibility to keep working on the SLS in multiple modes is very convenient. In addition the SLS has an excellent trackpad, it""s 5.5"" diagonally with a minimal edge (which is better than a completely smooth hand rest area). It also vibrates slightly when you ""click"" on it, so instead of 2 buttons, the whole trackpad is the left mouse button. Like I said I have other highend laptops, The SLS has the fastest graphics processor out of all of them. Period. It beat all others by 10-20%, so for light gaming/graphics work it""s a star. But I also do software development on my laptops (which is why I have several). In testing Visual Studio loading and light DB work, the SLS was the slowest. At first I was tempted to blame windows 11, so I disabled some of the new security features, and my times changed by less than 1-2% (faster). [Also good to know Windows 11 new security features don""t cause huge performance issues on a new machine] So I ran Crystal Disk Mark (against my 512 Gb SSD - And I found the cause of the slowness). All of my other notebooks have at least 1Tb nvme gen 3 drives. The SLS has a gen 3 nvme drive, but its as 2242 form factor, my others are all 2280""s, all performing reads at about 3000MB/s. So the SLS with stock 512GB drive, is on the slow slow side. Here""s the good news/bad news, the SSD is a replaceable device, but MS only recommends it be done professionally. I""ve upgraded several of my recent notebooks (both memory and SSD (the SLS cannot have it""s memory upgraded)). I wish MS would make it easier for end users to upgrade/repair their devices. I""ve learned what it takes, it can be done, but it (currently) voids the warranty. The other good news is the SLS also supports Thunderbolt 3/4 connectivity, which will allow you use a Thunderbolt connected g3 nvme drive at full speed, faster than the provided 512GB internal SSD drive. In fact the two Thundebolt4/USB4 ports also support power delivery and can be used to drive 2 additional USB Monitors from the USB ports both at 4K 60Hz. I tested with a 2K and 4K display and encountered no problems, both were recognised and configured automatically. I""m certainly happy MS finally offers a high end notebook with Thunderbolt connectivity, this was my biggest disappointment with their previous laptops. I also wish that there was a SD or micro SDcard reader (there is not). This is the best Notebook Microsoft has produced. I don""t understand why they skimped on a slower SSD, maybe the larger drive performs better (I don""t know). I wish the SSD were more easily replaceable. But I love the keyboard, trackpad, display combination. I""ve adjusted to Windows 11 differences, no big deal as far as I""m concerned. MS has enhanced several of their apps to take greater advantage of inking support (using the stylus to write lines/text), more should be made of the enormous improvements in Notes etc. MS claims that you could can get 19 hrs on the battery, well I used it for a full day doing what I normally do, and got a 10% battery warning after 12 hrs. No gaming, but screen was 80% bright and used non-stop. Probably the best battery life I""ve gotten from a standard notebook (no extended battery). For just browsing the internet and light office work this ""puter is fast, the Wi-Fi 6 support works very well. The build quality is exceptional, and given its size, the sound quality is exceptional, it seems to come from multiple directions (yea). And Windows Hello (Facial Recognition use for auto logon) works exceptionally well, I""ve used it before and never have I had it works as well as this SLS even in very low light.In the end I decided I had to deduct a star as it should have a top notch SSD drive as it affects my primary job as a software developer (but it can be ""fixed"").",4,positive,The user uses this laptop with the surface pen to annotate drawings.,I annotate a lot of drawings,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/fa3c293a54c12813381e6179cdb3b046,2021-12-14T05:12:19,"I annotate a lot of drawings, I love this new pencil.This notebook is a new design for MS, it""s thinner that their previous laptops (but about the same 4lbs weight), but it has 3 display modes: Laptop, Tablet and Stage mode.",WriteAction,Action Exist

The 14.4 inch, 3-way movement touch screen, the 11th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with the 16 GB of memory and the 512 GB of space on the hard drive will help you to achieve creative your goals. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I found Windows 11 to be an easy transition from Windows 10. It was much more seamless than previous Windows system changes I have experienced. Importing website tabs from another computer or even moving folders and information around the Surface Laptop was prompt, quick and easy. A cool new feature is facial recognition using the camera facing you. That is a great way to log in to the Surface Laptop. The light up keyboard is a great touch that I really enjoyed as well. I moved 3 GB of music, using a Type C flash drive, from another laptop to the Surface Laptop with the Thunderbolt port. It blazed a new path of how fast you can move songs only taking a few seconds to transfer! I also found this to be true with moving pictures over or even documents using the Thunderbolt 4 port. The only negative I think is the fact that there are only two Thunderbolt 4 ports. That is simply not enough in my opinion. I would like to plug in a mouse dongle, Xbox controller and flash drive, but that is 3 items and the Surface Laptop provides only two connections. I used an extra Type C hub to overcome that deficiency. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the touch pad and its enhanced feeling vibrations for a better experience but I sometimes prefer a wireless mouse so the hub helped me to add that feature. It is a preference for me, but not everyone has to do it.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Intel Core i7 (11th Gen) with 16 GB memory and 512 SSD Platinum came well packaged and protected. Made of magnesium and aluminum the Surface Laptop has great solid feel. The sides vent the heat out of the Surface Laptop when needed. I really never even noticed that the heat was spread out there. Surface Laptop did a nice and discrete job on this feature.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The 14.4 Touchscreen has resolution of 2400x1600 pixels in a 3:2 ratio with a 120hz refresh rate. What does that mean? It has a beautifully made Touchscreen with detailed pixels providing the best picture, while the refresh rate allows the screen to keep up with your movies, gaming or music. There are three dynamic positions for the Surface Laptop: There is a regular Laptop setup, an angled Stage setup and a Studio setup. To accomplish this feat, a special ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂDynamic Woven HingeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ was made to help move the Touchscreen. The images produced by the Touchscreen are vibrant, sharp and lively looking at any angle or display option you choose. I prefer the stage setup because the screen is tilted toward my eyes, making it easier to look at. It is also efficient for drawing or writing on it as well. The best option for drawing or writing is probably the Studio setup which the screen lays almost completely flat on the keyboard. I think this is pretty innovative and useful.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I play guitar and used the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Studio OneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ software on the Surface Laptop. It is setup through ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Audiobox USB 96 interfaceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ with two monitor speakers. The software allows you to record songs, edit and playback. I had no issues with lag-time, skipping or missing a beat at all. I enjoyed the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂStageÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode when recording music. If I wanted to name a song, or track or just a riff, all I had to do is just had tap on the specific field and an onscreen keyboard pops up that is plenty big and easy to use. But if you prefer a traditional Laptop feel for your music playing, the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂClassicÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode and regular keyboard will work just as well. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ You can multi-task easily with the Surface Laptop. You can open and keep a ton of tabs without losing speed; play complex games with intense graphics; listen to your favorite music stream or stream your favorite movie. I have used the Surface Laptop as my engine for guitar recording and software. The battery does drain pretty quickly when you play heavy loaded intense games. Of course, if you have the Surface Laptop plugged in, this ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlimitationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ goes away. For example, Tekken 7 in HD is an intense video game with its crazy fighting styles, scenic backgrounds and unbelievable moves. During this game, battery life went down quickly when I had the Surface Laptop unplugged. But this is easily fixed by plugging the Surface Laptop into a surge protector or outlet. In contrast, the battery life pretty much lasted all day when I moved information (folder to folder or files to a Flash Drive, Thunderbolt 4 port), searched the web with open tabs, listened to a lot of music or streamed movies. I do want to add that the part of the plug that goes into the actual laptop is unconventional in a good way. It is a little larger than your average size and it is magnetic! That means you don^t have to accidentally worry about knocking the power supply out! ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Surface Slim Pen 2 is magnetic and has a button on top and a side button as well. I synced it to the Surface Laptop with Bluetooth. The Slim Pen 2 attaches and charges just underneath the front of the keyboard magnetically. It snaps securely in place and it doesn^t come off until you remove it! I used this Surface Slim Pen 2 when moving around the touchscreen instead of using my fingers. The Pen works much better and leaves no fingerprints! Tap the top of the Pen to bring up whiteboard that is available for anything from drawing to bringing pictures in to modify.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Movies that have support Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos special sound will play on the Surface Laptop. The sound of the laptop for music and/or movies is outstanding. Four speakers on the sides of the Surface Laptop put out detailed sounds. There are also 2 woofers under the keyboard that compliment the other 4 speakers, for a well rounded sound. Of course you can always hookup the Surface Laptop Bluetooth (5.1 version) and a Bluetooth capable speaker. I tried out both the speakers in the Laptop and a Bluetooth Ralis speaker. Of course the Ralis speaker sounded amazing but the speaker system inside the Laptop was top notch. I actively listened to movies I streamed from Disney+, like these Marvel movies: Antman, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Infinity War. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Music is easy to transfer with the Thunderbolt ports (size similar to a Type C but faster). There is plenty of music space when you decide how you want to setup the Surface Laptop. I put music from different genres and in mp3 and FLAC. FLAC files have the quality sound over MP3s, but the FLAC files are a lot larger in size. I chose the MP3s over FLAC files, essentially because of HD space (512GB). The sound was still outstanding and is the best I have heard from a laptop computer!ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Games are stunning up to 2400x1600 pixels (if the game allows) with the NVIDIA GeoForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU! Battlefield 4 has exceptional realism and Tekken 7 complex on screen moves were no match for this Surface Laptop! The sound was also enveloping for a great experience, putting you closer to the action. The only drawback to these games is that they take up a lot of space on the HD. If you intend on using the Surface Laptop for just gaming only, the 512GB HD isn^t quite big enough for loads of high speed, intense games. There are other options of this Surface Laptop with larger HDs, you could get if you wanted. But for casual gaming, streaming, pictures, music, or guitar recording, the Surface Laptop performs exceptionally well.This Laptop is a great conduit to help you achieve your goals, whatever they may be.

ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I found Windows 11 to be an easy transition from Windows 10. It was much more seamless than previous Windows system changes I have experienced. Importing website tabs from another computer or even moving folders and information around the Surface Laptop was prompt, quick and easy. A cool new feature is facial recognition using the camera facing you. That is a great way to log in to the Surface Laptop. The light up keyboard is a great touch that I really enjoyed as well. I moved 3 GB of music, using a Type C flash drive, from another laptop to the Surface Laptop with the Thunderbolt port. It blazed a new path of how fast you can move songs only taking a few seconds to transfer! I also found this to be true with moving pictures over or even documents using the Thunderbolt 4 port. The only negative I think is the fact that there are only two Thunderbolt 4 ports. That is simply not enough in my opinion. I would like to plug in a mouse dongle, Xbox controller and flash drive, but that is 3 items and the Surface Laptop provides only two connections. I used an extra Type C hub to overcome that deficiency. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the touch pad and its enhanced feeling vibrations for a better experience but I sometimes prefer a wireless mouse so the hub helped me to add that feature.

The sound was also enveloping for a great experience, putting you closer to the action. The only drawback to these games is that they take up a lot of space on the HD.

12671,12671,1934,Microsoft - Surface Laptop Studio ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Touch Screen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Intel Core i7 -16GB Memory ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 512GB SSD - Platinum,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/A1Y_00001,PlayAction,Person,Universal,ScreenRefreshRate,"The Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio is a great blend of computing power and the latest technologies. The 14.4 inch, 3-way movement touch screen, the 11th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with the 16 GB of memory and the 512 GB of space on the hard drive will help you to achieve creative your goals. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I found Windows 11 to be an easy transition from Windows 10. It was much more seamless than previous Windows system changes I have experienced. Importing website tabs from another computer or even moving folders and information around the Surface Laptop was prompt, quick and easy. A cool new feature is facial recognition using the camera facing you. That is a great way to log in to the Surface Laptop. The light up keyboard is a great touch that I really enjoyed as well. I moved 3 GB of music, using a Type C flash drive, from another laptop to the Surface Laptop with the Thunderbolt port. It blazed a new path of how fast you can move songs only taking a few seconds to transfer! I also found this to be true with moving pictures over or even documents using the Thunderbolt 4 port. The only negative I think is the fact that there are only two Thunderbolt 4 ports. That is simply not enough in my opinion. I would like to plug in a mouse dongle, Xbox controller and flash drive, but that is 3 items and the Surface Laptop provides only two connections. I used an extra Type C hub to overcome that deficiency. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the touch pad and its enhanced feeling vibrations for a better experience but I sometimes prefer a wireless mouse so the hub helped me to add that feature. It is a preference for me, but not everyone has to do it.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Intel Core i7 (11th Gen) with 16 GB memory and 512 SSD Platinum came well packaged and protected. Made of magnesium and aluminum the Surface Laptop has great solid feel. The sides vent the heat out of the Surface Laptop when needed. I really never even noticed that the heat was spread out there. Surface Laptop did a nice and discrete job on this feature.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The 14.4 Touchscreen has resolution of 2400x1600 pixels in a 3:2 ratio with a 120hz refresh rate. What does that mean? It has a beautifully made Touchscreen with detailed pixels providing the best picture, while the refresh rate allows the screen to keep up with your movies, gaming or music. There are three dynamic positions for the Surface Laptop: There is a regular Laptop setup, an angled Stage setup and a Studio setup. To accomplish this feat, a special ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂDynamic Woven HingeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ was made to help move the Touchscreen. The images produced by the Touchscreen are vibrant, sharp and lively looking at any angle or display option you choose. I prefer the stage setup because the screen is tilted toward my eyes, making it easier to look at. It is also efficient for drawing or writing on it as well. The best option for drawing or writing is probably the Studio setup which the screen lays almost completely flat on the keyboard. I think this is pretty innovative and useful.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I play guitar and used the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Studio OneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ software on the Surface Laptop. It is setup through ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Audiobox USB 96 interfaceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ with two monitor speakers. The software allows you to record songs, edit and playback. I had no issues with lag-time, skipping or missing a beat at all. I enjoyed the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂStageÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode when recording music. If I wanted to name a song, or track or just a riff, all I had to do is just had tap on the specific field and an onscreen keyboard pops up that is plenty big and easy to use. But if you prefer a traditional Laptop feel for your music playing, the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂClassicÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode and regular keyboard will work just as well. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ You can multi-task easily with the Surface Laptop. You can open and keep a ton of tabs without losing speed; play complex games with intense graphics; listen to your favorite music stream or stream your favorite movie. I have used the Surface Laptop as my engine for guitar recording and software. The battery does drain pretty quickly when you play heavy loaded intense games. Of course, if you have the Surface Laptop plugged in, this ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlimitationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ goes away. For example, Tekken 7 in HD is an intense video game with its crazy fighting styles, scenic backgrounds and unbelievable moves. During this game, battery life went down quickly when I had the Surface Laptop unplugged. But this is easily fixed by plugging the Surface Laptop into a surge protector or outlet. In contrast, the battery life pretty much lasted all day when I moved information (folder to folder or files to a Flash Drive, Thunderbolt 4 port), searched the web with open tabs, listened to a lot of music or streamed movies. I do want to add that the part of the plug that goes into the actual laptop is unconventional in a good way. It is a little larger than your average size and it is magnetic! That means you don^t have to accidentally worry about knocking the power supply out! ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Surface Slim Pen 2 is magnetic and has a button on top and a side button as well. I synced it to the Surface Laptop with Bluetooth. The Slim Pen 2 attaches and charges just underneath the front of the keyboard magnetically. It snaps securely in place and it doesn^t come off until you remove it! I used this Surface Slim Pen 2 when moving around the touchscreen instead of using my fingers. The Pen works much better and leaves no fingerprints! Tap the top of the Pen to bring up whiteboard that is available for anything from drawing to bringing pictures in to modify.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Movies that have support Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos special sound will play on the Surface Laptop. The sound of the laptop for music and/or movies is outstanding. Four speakers on the sides of the Surface Laptop put out detailed sounds. There are also 2 woofers under the keyboard that compliment the other 4 speakers, for a well rounded sound. Of course you can always hookup the Surface Laptop Bluetooth (5.1 version) and a Bluetooth capable speaker. I tried out both the speakers in the Laptop and a Bluetooth Ralis speaker. Of course the Ralis speaker sounded amazing but the speaker system inside the Laptop was top notch. I actively listened to movies I streamed from Disney+, like these Marvel movies: Antman, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Infinity War. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Music is easy to transfer with the Thunderbolt ports (size similar to a Type C but faster). There is plenty of music space when you decide how you want to setup the Surface Laptop. I put music from different genres and in mp3 and FLAC. FLAC files have the quality sound over MP3s, but the FLAC files are a lot larger in size. I chose the MP3s over FLAC files, essentially because of HD space (512GB). The sound was still outstanding and is the best I have heard from a laptop computer!ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Games are stunning up to 2400x1600 pixels (if the game allows) with the NVIDIA GeoForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU!

I think this is pretty innovative and useful.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I play guitar and used the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Studio OneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ software on the Surface Laptop. It is setup through ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Audiobox USB 96 interfaceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ with two monitor speakers. The software allows you to record songs, edit and playback. I had no issues with lag-time, skipping or missing a beat at all. I enjoyed the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂStageÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode when recording music. If I wanted to name a song, or track or just a riff, all I had to do is just had tap on the specific field and an onscreen keyboard pops up that is plenty big and easy to use. But if you prefer a traditional Laptop feel for your music playing, the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂClassicÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode and regular keyboard will work just as well. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ You can multi-task easily with the Surface Laptop. You can open and keep a ton of tabs without losing speed; play complex games with intense graphics; listen to your favorite music stream or stream your favorite movie. I have used the Surface Laptop as my engine for guitar recording and software. The battery does drain pretty quickly when you play heavy loaded intense games. Of course, if you have the Surface Laptop plugged in, this ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlimitationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ goes away. For example, Tekken 7 in HD is an intense video game with its crazy fighting styles, scenic backgrounds and unbelievable moves. During this game, battery life went down quickly when I had the Surface Laptop unplugged. But this is easily fixed by plugging the Surface Laptop into a surge protector or outlet. In contrast, the battery life pretty much lasted all day when I moved information (folder to folder or files to a Flash Drive, Thunderbolt 4 port), searched the web with open tabs, listened to a lot of music or streamed movies. I do want to add that the part of the plug that goes into the actual laptop is unconventional in a good way. It is a little larger than your average size and it is magnetic! That means you don^t have to accidentally worry about knocking the power supply out! ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Surface Slim Pen 2 is magnetic and has a button on top and a side button as well. I synced it to the Surface Laptop with Bluetooth. The Slim Pen 2 attaches and charges just underneath the front of the keyboard magnetically. It snaps securely in place and it doesn^t come off until you remove it! I used this Surface Slim Pen 2 when moving around the touchscreen instead of using my fingers. The Pen works much better and leaves no fingerprints! Tap the top of the Pen to bring up whiteboard that is available for anything from drawing to bringing pictures in to modify.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Movies that have support Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos special sound will play on the Surface Laptop. The sound of the laptop for music and/or movies is outstanding. Four speakers on the sides of the Surface Laptop put out detailed sounds. There are also 2 woofers under the keyboard that compliment the other 4 speakers, for a well rounded sound. Of course you can always hookup the Surface Laptop Bluetooth (5.1 version) and a Bluetooth capable speaker. I tried out both the speakers in the Laptop and a Bluetooth Ralis speaker. Of course the Ralis speaker sounded amazing but the speaker system inside the Laptop was top notch. I actively listened to movies I streamed from Disney+, like these Marvel movies: Antman, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Infinity War. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Music is easy to transfer with the Thunderbolt ports (size similar to a Type C but faster). There is plenty of music space when you decide how you want to setup the Surface Laptop. I put music from different genres and in mp3 and FLAC. FLAC files have the quality sound over MP3s, but the FLAC files are a lot larger in size. I chose the MP3s over FLAC files, essentially because of HD space (512GB). The sound was still outstanding and is the best I have heard from a laptop computer!ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Games are stunning up to 2400x1600 pixels (if the game allows) with the NVIDIA GeoForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU! Battlefield 4 has exceptional realism and Tekken 7 complex on screen moves were no match for this Surface Laptop! The sound was also enveloping for a great experience, putting you closer to the action. The only drawback to these games is that they take up a lot of space on the HD. If you intend on using the Surface Laptop for just gaming only, the 512GB HD isn^t quite big enough for loads of high speed, intense games. There are other options of this Surface Laptop with larger HDs, you could get if you wanted. But for casual gaming, streaming, pictures, music, or guitar recording, the Surface Laptop performs exceptionally well.This Laptop is a great conduit to help you achieve your goals, whatever they may be. The Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio gets the hard work done and gets the play fun done as well.

The 14.4 inch, 3-way movement touch screen, the 11th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with the 16 GB of memory and the 512 GB of space on the hard drive will help you to achieve creative your goals. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I found Windows 11 to be an easy transition from Windows 10. It was much more seamless than previous Windows system changes I have experienced. Importing website tabs from another computer or even moving folders and information around the Surface Laptop was prompt, quick and easy. A cool new feature is facial recognition using the camera facing you. That is a great way to log in to the Surface Laptop. The light up keyboard is a great touch that I really enjoyed as well. I moved 3 GB of music, using a Type C flash drive, from another laptop to the Surface Laptop with the Thunderbolt port. It blazed a new path of how fast you can move songs only taking a few seconds to transfer! I also found this to be true with moving pictures over or even documents using the Thunderbolt 4 port. The only negative I think is the fact that there are only two Thunderbolt 4 ports. That is simply not enough in my opinion. I would like to plug in a mouse dongle, Xbox controller and flash drive, but that is 3 items and the Surface Laptop provides only two connections. I used an extra Type C hub to overcome that deficiency. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the touch pad and its enhanced feeling vibrations for a better experience but I sometimes prefer a wireless mouse so the hub helped me to add that feature. It is a preference for me, but not everyone has to do it.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Intel Core i7 (11th Gen) with 16 GB memory and 512 SSD Platinum came well packaged and protected. Made of magnesium and aluminum the Surface Laptop has great solid feel. The sides vent the heat out of the Surface Laptop when needed. I really never even noticed that the heat was spread out there. Surface Laptop did a nice and discrete job on this feature.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The 14.4 Touchscreen has resolution of 2400x1600 pixels in a 3:2 ratio with a 120hz refresh rate. What does that mean? It has a beautifully made Touchscreen with detailed pixels providing the best picture, while the refresh rate allows the screen to keep up with your movies, gaming or music. There are three dynamic positions for the Surface Laptop: There is a regular Laptop setup, an angled Stage setup and a Studio setup. To accomplish this feat, a special ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂDynamic Woven HingeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ was made to help move the Touchscreen. The images produced by the Touchscreen are vibrant, sharp and lively looking at any angle or display option you choose. I prefer the stage setup because the screen is tilted toward my eyes, making it easier to look at. It is also efficient for drawing or writing on it as well. The best option for drawing or writing is probably the Studio setup which the screen lays almost completely flat on the keyboard.

13167,13167,1941,Microsoft - Surface Laptop Studio ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 14.4ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Touch Screen ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ Intel Core i7 -16GB Memory ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ 512GB SSD - Platinum,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Product/A1Y_00001,ListenAction,Person,Universal,ProcessingPower,"The Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio is a great blend of computing power and the latest technologies. The 14.4 inch, 3-way movement touch screen, the 11th Generation Intel Core i7 processor with the 16 GB of memory and the 512 GB of space on the hard drive will help you to achieve creative your goals. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I found Windows 11 to be an easy transition from Windows 10. It was much more seamless than previous Windows system changes I have experienced. Importing website tabs from another computer or even moving folders and information around the Surface Laptop was prompt, quick and easy. A cool new feature is facial recognition using the camera facing you. That is a great way to log in to the Surface Laptop. The light up keyboard is a great touch that I really enjoyed as well. I moved 3 GB of music, using a Type C flash drive, from another laptop to the Surface Laptop with the Thunderbolt port. It blazed a new path of how fast you can move songs only taking a few seconds to transfer! I also found this to be true with moving pictures over or even documents using the Thunderbolt 4 port. The only negative I think is the fact that there are only two Thunderbolt 4 ports. That is simply not enough in my opinion. I would like to plug in a mouse dongle, Xbox controller and flash drive, but that is 3 items and the Surface Laptop provides only two connections. I used an extra Type C hub to overcome that deficiency. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the touch pad and its enhanced feeling vibrations for a better experience but I sometimes prefer a wireless mouse so the hub helped me to add that feature. It is a preference for me, but not everyone has to do it.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Intel Core i7 (11th Gen) with 16 GB memory and 512 SSD Platinum came well packaged and protected. Made of magnesium and aluminum the Surface Laptop has great solid feel. The sides vent the heat out of the Surface Laptop when needed. I really never even noticed that the heat was spread out there. Surface Laptop did a nice and discrete job on this feature.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The 14.4 Touchscreen has resolution of 2400x1600 pixels in a 3:2 ratio with a 120hz refresh rate. What does that mean? It has a beautifully made Touchscreen with detailed pixels providing the best picture, while the refresh rate allows the screen to keep up with your movies, gaming or music. There are three dynamic positions for the Surface Laptop: There is a regular Laptop setup, an angled Stage setup and a Studio setup. To accomplish this feat, a special ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂDynamic Woven HingeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ was made to help move the Touchscreen. The images produced by the Touchscreen are vibrant, sharp and lively looking at any angle or display option you choose. I prefer the stage setup because the screen is tilted toward my eyes, making it easier to look at. It is also efficient for drawing or writing on it as well. The best option for drawing or writing is probably the Studio setup which the screen lays almost completely flat on the keyboard. I think this is pretty innovative and useful.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ I play guitar and used the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Studio OneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ software on the Surface Laptop. It is setup through ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂPreSonus Audiobox USB 96 interfaceÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ with two monitor speakers. The software allows you to record songs, edit and playback. I had no issues with lag-time, skipping or missing a beat at all. I enjoyed the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂStageÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode when recording music. If I wanted to name a song, or track or just a riff, all I had to do is just had tap on the specific field and an onscreen keyboard pops up that is plenty big and easy to use. But if you prefer a traditional Laptop feel for your music playing, the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂClassicÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ mode and regular keyboard will work just as well. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ You can multi-task easily with the Surface Laptop. You can open and keep a ton of tabs without losing speed; play complex games with intense graphics; listen to your favorite music stream or stream your favorite movie. I have used the Surface Laptop as my engine for guitar recording and software. The battery does drain pretty quickly when you play heavy loaded intense games. Of course, if you have the Surface Laptop plugged in, this ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂlimitationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ goes away. For example, Tekken 7 in HD is an intense video game with its crazy fighting styles, scenic backgrounds and unbelievable moves. During this game, battery life went down quickly when I had the Surface Laptop unplugged. But this is easily fixed by plugging the Surface Laptop into a surge protector or outlet. In contrast, the battery life pretty much lasted all day when I moved information (folder to folder or files to a Flash Drive, Thunderbolt 4 port), searched the web with open tabs, listened to a lot of music or streamed movies. I do want to add that the part of the plug that goes into the actual laptop is unconventional in a good way. It is a little larger than your average size and it is magnetic! That means you don^t have to accidentally worry about knocking the power supply out! ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ The Surface Slim Pen 2 is magnetic and has a button on top and a side button as well. I synced it to the Surface Laptop with Bluetooth. The Slim Pen 2 attaches and charges just underneath the front of the keyboard magnetically. It snaps securely in place and it doesn^t come off until you remove it! I used this Surface Slim Pen 2 when moving around the touchscreen instead of using my fingers. The Pen works much better and leaves no fingerprints! Tap the top of the Pen to bring up whiteboard that is available for anything from drawing to bringing pictures in to modify.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Movies that have support Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos special sound will play on the Surface Laptop. The sound of the laptop for music and/or movies is outstanding. Four speakers on the sides of the Surface Laptop put out detailed sounds. There are also 2 woofers under the keyboard that compliment the other 4 speakers, for a well rounded sound. Of course you can always hookup the Surface Laptop Bluetooth (5.1 version) and a Bluetooth capable speaker. I tried out both the speakers in the Laptop and a Bluetooth Ralis speaker. Of course the Ralis speaker sounded amazing but the speaker system inside the Laptop was top notch. I actively listened to movies I streamed from Disney+, like these Marvel movies: Antman, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and Infinity War. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Music is easy to transfer with the Thunderbolt ports (size similar to a Type C but faster). There is plenty of music space when you decide how you want to setup the Surface Laptop. I put music from different genres and in mp3 and FLAC. FLAC files have the quality sound over MP3s, but the FLAC files are a lot larger in size. I chose the MP3s over FLAC files, essentially because of HD space (512GB). The sound was still outstanding and is the best I have heard from a laptop computer!ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¢ Games are stunning up to 2400x1600 pixels (if the game allows) with the NVIDIA GeoForce RTX 3050 Ti GPU! Battlefield 4 has exceptional realism and Tekken 7 complex on screen moves were no match for this Surface Laptop! The sound was also enveloping for a great experience, putting you closer to the action. The only drawback to these games is that they take up a lot of space on the HD. If you intend on using the Surface Laptop for just gaming only, the 512GB HD isn^t quite big enough for loads of high speed, intense games. There are other options of this Surface Laptop with larger HDs, you could get if you wanted. But for casual gaming, streaming, pictures, music, or guitar recording, the Surface Laptop performs exceptionally well.This Laptop is a great conduit to help you achieve your goals, whatever they may be.

Has a backlit keyboard and a nice large trackpad.The all platinum aluminum body looks nice and sleek. Super high quality build and construction. Has a unique ""tiered"" looking design, but I think that is by design as the pen is held underneath the front bottom. Has some weight to it @ 4 lbs but I do not consider it heavy nor a problem carrying it around. Also to save me a headache, I purchased a small USB C docking port that allows for another display and to connect my USB-A devices (my gaming mouse).First time booting it up after charging, you are greeted with Windows 11 walkthrough to set up the Studio to your preferences. Took me about 20 minutes after connecting to wifi and applying all the updates. As this is my 1st time using Windows 11, it reminds me of a hybrid Win10 x Apple crossover thing going on. Though with a little bit of searching I moved my Start Menu back to the left to make it feel more recognizable to me.2x Thunderbolt 4 ports can let you expand the Studio to give it multiple options, whether it be external storages, extra displays, or use external peripherals like mice and printers via docking stations.Gaming is great for this mobile beast. 3050Ti is more than enough to handle my whole Steam and Epic libraries on high settings. Some AAA titles did have me turn down the settings to Mid but that did not put a hamper on my experience at all. 120 refresh rate @ 2400 x 1600 made gaming look nice and smooth.I love how the Studio can go from Laptop to a tablet /w stand with ease! Even all the way to flat. Using the Pen made drawing and editing fun. Even better than using my Tablets that I usually daily drive for it. Touch screen with it""s refresh rate is a perfect pair.Sound quality to me is where the Studio shines! OMG it is beyond GREAT. I have compared it to my Omen with Bang and Olufsen and even the king XPS and the Studio imho blew them both out of the water. It is LOUD, Crisp, Clear and even packs the oomph and deep basses.Work, School or personal entertainment. The Surface Laptop Studio does it all and with ease.

I have used several different Surface devices over the years and have absolutely loved them. This is due to Microsoft taking user feedback seriously and applying it to its next generation devices. The Surface Laptop Studio is a beautifully designed machine offering some of the best hardware available. Need a faster processor, more storage, or more RAM? Microsoft allows the customer to change the CPU, RAM, and storage capacity prior to purchase without the insane markups seen by one of its major competitors. Pros:* Powerful CPU and GPU: The Surface Laptop Studio is powered by the new quad-core 11th Gen Intel Core H Series processor and Nvidia 3050ti. So, what does that mean? Sheer performance. Not only can this Surface run popular games like Valorant, Apex, Back 4 Blood, and Call of Duty, it does so flawlessly at 2400 x 1600 resolution / 120 hz refresh rate. This will be my go-to device when I am traveling and feel the need to game. Multitasking? No problem, it does so with ease. I have been able to listen to a Zoom meeting while browsing the web with multiple tabs open and work on a PowerPoint all at the same time without it skipping a beat. With the hardware specs included with this device, it would be great for any power user such as a gamer, college student, or business owner. * Touchscreen with Slim Pen 2: It responds to touch seamlessly and when paired with the Surface Slim Pen 2 is a note taking/content creating machine. I really enjoy the ergonomics when writing on the folded down screen. The Surface Pen 2 is very responsive and accurate. I especially like that the Slim Pen 2 is magnetic and can be charged on the underside of the keyboard.* Windows 11 OS: This is my first experience using the new Windows 11 operating system and I am really enjoying it. Everything seems very intuitive and easy to use. Overall, I think Microsoft really nailed it.* Ports: It comes with 2 USB 4.0 ports with Thunderbolt 4 support as well as a headphone jack and charging slot. I ended up buying a USB-C hub to go with the computer so I would be able to use more than 2 devices at a time including USB type A, HDMI and DisplayPort cables, and an Ethernet cable. While most of the headphones I own are Bluetooth compatible, I do appreciate Microsoft adding a regular headphone jack.* Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision/Vision IQ: These are premium features I am thrilled Microsoft included. The speakers on the Surface paired with Dolby Atmos supported content deliver cinematic sound. Dolby Vision/IQ allows for dynamic adjustment and optimization of the picture based on supported content and lighting conditions in the room. More and more content/content providers are supporting these standards (ie: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney +).* Camera and facial recognition: The front camera on the Surface supports 1080p HD video. On the Zoom video calls I have participated in for work my video is crystal clear. I also enabled the facial recognition feature which uses the front camera to unlock the computer. It has worked flawlessly. It is much more convenient then typing in a password every time I want to log in.Indeterminate:* Battery life: The Surface Laptop Studio boasts up to 18 hours of continuous battery life; however, I have come nowhere near this. I usually average 4-8 hours of use before requiring a charge. I will have to play with the battery settings to see if I can increase battery life without a degradation in performance.

The power cord has a blade type plug magnetically held in place that is a big improvement over USB C or pin jack type plugs because it""ll be much less lightly to suffer wear and tear damage over time.Although the Slim Pen stylus costs a hundred bucks or so extra, I think it""s worth it. It can be used on a wide variety of apps, is great to take notes with or just fun to play with on the Whiteboard, and can be used in place of your finger on the touchscreen.I have always been skeptical of Windows OS edition upgrades as being nothing more than profiteering off a captive audience but I really like Windows 11. It has a very updated and clean, modern look, with a redesigned taskbar with app icons and the menu button centered in the middle and a lighter colored default theme.Now for a few things to keep in mind when considering this laptop:The price of this laptop is at the high-end for how it""s equipped. A laptop similarly equipped with Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti, and touchscreen can be gotten for less, but maybe not with the same look, build quality feel, and touchpen stylus utility. The accessory ports on this laptop are limited to two Thunderbolt (basically high speed USB-C) ports and one 3.5mm audio pin jack. There""s no USB-A (the rectangular port), no HDMI, and no ethernet ports, meaning anything you have with one of those type connections you won""t be able to use with this laptop.Lastly, laptops equipped like this one are not lightweight. This one weighs in at 4 pounds, something to consider if you""re going to be carrying it around a lot, like to college classes.Overall this a great quality top of the line machine, with great looks, utility, and performance.",5,positive,The user likes to write notes using this product.,is great to take notes,http://linked.aub.edu.lb/actionrec/Annotation/d7ca0744d5a5886040f3f0a50d240573,2021-12-17T05:58:51,"It can be used on a wide variety of apps, is great to take notes with or just fun to play with on the Whiteboard, and can be used in place of your finger on the touchscreen.I have always been skeptical of Windows OS edition upgrades as being nothing more than profiteering off a captive audience but I really like Windows 11.",WriteAction,Action Exist

This laptop brings Windows 11 to life.It is powered by 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics processor. The 16GB RAM handles heavy tasks of video editing, graphics heavy games, multitasking, etc. smoothly and with ease.

Using the Surface Slim Pen 2 with this laptop offers the best stylus experience. It simulates the real inking experience while providing haptic feedback as you use. You can customize the intensity of the feedback under settings. The best part about the pen is that it is rechargable and is held magnetically right under the laptop.The laptop came with 512GB SSD.

As for the ports on this laptop, it comes with two Thunderbolt USB-C ports, There are not many ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack and the Surface Connect port for charging and to connect the dock. There is no SD card slot though. I wish there were more than 2 USB-C ports so it can be used as a charger. The laptop is also equipped with the latest Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity. I liked having the option to connect my Xbox controller to play supported games.The keyboard is the best I have used in any laptop. It is very quiet and supports 4 levels of backlighting. The trackpad is amazing. It is the first haptic touchpad on a Surface device. It is smooth, feels snappier and is configurable.The front facing camera is a full HD. I was impressed with how well the color and sharpness are on my video chats. There is also the infrared camera that you can use to setup Windows Hello authentication.

Certainly I think its more manageable than an XPS with no removable keyboard or the Surface Book. But if I just wanted a reader, the iPad would clearly be better. However, the Surface Pro 7 is much more versatile. I""ve already expanded the storage via SDXC, and plan to get a USB-C PD dock for charger/connectivity at my desk.
